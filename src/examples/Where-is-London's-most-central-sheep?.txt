> *It's time to tackle one of London's great unanswered questions.*
> 
> Where is London's most central sheep?

> I'm only interested in live sheep, so not a cuddly toy in Hamleys nor lamb
> cutlets at The Ritz. I'm not interested in temporary sheep like those that get
> driven over Southwark Bridge in September or shorn at the Lambeth Country Show
> in June. Also by 'most central' I mean closest to the centre of London which
> is generally agreed to be Trafalgar Square, specifically the statue of Charles
> I at the top of Whitehall. Hopefully that's clear.
> 
> I don't believe Charles III keeps sheep at Buckingham Palace, nor has anybody
> else nearby got a large enough back garden. London Zoo's website does not
> reveal the existence of any sheep - at best llamas. Also none of the armed
> forces based in London have a regimental sheep, the UK's sole ovine mascot
> being a ram called Pte Derby XXXIII owned by the Mercian Regiment in
> Lichfield. So, city farms it is.
> 
> Where is London's most central city farm?
> 
> 
> 
> That's easy, it's Vauxhall City Farm which is just over a mile south of
> Trafalgar Square. It's been here on the edge of the Pleasure Gardens since
> 1976 so is one of London's oldest city farms and receives over 60,000 visitors
> a year. Some of its residents live out front in wooden pens but they're not
> sheep, they're goats as any self-respecting three year old could tell
> you. The entrance is off to the left past an outdoor desk staffed by cheery
> volunteers who'll grin, sell you feed and encourage you to make a donation.
> The City Farm is 50 next year so has an anniversary appeal underway,
> should you have part of £250,000 to spare. For the sheep turn right.
> 
> Where is London's most central sheep?
> 
> 
> 
> Here she is. She's in the sheep enclosure at Vauxhall City Farm, lapping away
> at a bowl of water resting on a spare tyre. She's a Shetland, a hardy
> breed with a good-natured temperament, so ideal for pottering around with
> toddlers in a confined space. There were many such underage visitors during my
> visit, all overexcited to be right up close to a sheep's head nuzzling through
> railings. Crossing the divide into the yard itself is more of a paid-for
> activity, or if you're a volunteer just part and parcel of your dung-sweeping
> duties. Alas I don't know what this sheep's name is, the City Farm isn't as
> keen as some in pinning biographical details to the railings, but there is no
> closer sheep to Trafalgar Square so she is London's most central sheep.
> 
> Where is London's second most central sheep?
> 
> 
> 
> You didn't think there was just one sheep did you? Here's another, this time a
> Herdwick, a larger shaggier breed. She's called Daffodil, or Daffy for short,
> and she's very much the poster girl for sheep at Vauxhall. I didn't see her
> initially, she was hiding inside a free-standing wooden structure as if trying
> to escape the hubbub, the yard also being home to three occasionally frisky
> alpacas called Rolo, Toffee and Cookie. I suspect sometimes Daffy hops up
> the steps to the top platform and surveys her domain like a woolly empress.
> She is thus not always the second most central sheep in the capital, sometimes
> she's first depending on the precise location of the other sheep.
> 
> Where is London's third most central sheep?
> 
> 
> 
> There are of course several sheep at Vauxhall, it would be silly and a tad
> cruel only to have two. Here are four of them crowding up against the railings
> by the pigpen because a small child has proffered a handful of scrummy animal
> feed. School parties tend to be taller and thus less conducive to low-level
> feeding, plus they may be about to be given a wheelbarrow each and asked to
> get stuck in. This particular corner of the farmyard by the entrance is
> actually the furthest north so I can state with some certainty that the back
> ewe was London's most central sheep at the time I took this photo, and next to
> her the second, third and fourth.
> 
> Where is London's fifth most central sheep?
> 
> Daffy didn't appear in that last photo so she was London's fifth most central
> sheep at the time.
> 
> Where is London's sixth most central sheep?
> 
> Also at Vauxhall City Farm. I counted seven sheep in the yard altogether, I
> just never managed to get them all in the same photo. I did try asking the
> keeper to confirm the precise number of sheep but unfortunately she didn't
> know. Whatever, given my count it must be the case that London's seven most
> central sheep are all here in SW8... and free to visit. Be sure to wash your
> hands thoroughly before exiting past the geese and buggy park, and yes the
> acrid whiff of animal excreta does eventually fade as you return to the
> outside world.
> 
> Where is London's eighth most central sheep?
> 
> Park that question for a second.
> 
> Where is London's second most central city farm?
> 
> 
> 
> That'll be in Spitalfields. It took some working out to confirm that this
> was the second closest to Trafalgar Square, I had to make myself a map
> using the extremely helpful list of London's city farms at
> londonfarmsandgardens.org.uk. They reckon there are twelve city farms in
> London but I reckon one of those is just over the border in Essex so it's
> eleven. The map's interesting because eight of the city farms form a
> near straight line running diagonally from Kentish Town through
> Hackney and Mudchute to the foot of Shooters Hill, but I
> think that's a coincidence. Spitalfields City Farm is on the site of a
> former railway depot and was also born in the 1970s, but is less cramped,
> easier to walk round and less pungent.
> 
> Where is London's eighth most central sheep?
> 
> 
> 
> That'll be Beatrix, another Herdwick ewe, here at Spitalfields City
> Farm. Their information game is strong so I know she used to graze on the
> North Downs in Surrey but lost an ear in a dog attack when she was young and
> moved here in August 2020. Her enclosure is a much better size, with scattered
> wood and the inevitable spare tyre, even room for gambolling. Don't expect to
> get close enough for feeding but that's fine because feeding's not permitted
> here anyway.
> 
> Where is London's ninth most central sheep?
> 
> 
> 
> You didn't think there was just one sheep at Spitalfields City Farm did you?
> There are several more hiding away in the byre, this time Castlemilk
> Moorits, a rare breed with brownish wool originally from Scotland.
> They're 37% Shetland, 28% Soay, 18% Manx and 17% Wiltshire Horn and all
> descended from a single ram on Sir Jock Buchanan-Jardine's estate, apparently.
> The information board also confirms there are nine of them here altogether
> with names like Twiglet, Lavender, Samphire and Rolo. Rolo is occasionally
> London's seventeenth most central sheep when he stands over by the
> polytunnels. London's most central donkeys are two pens away, one of
> whom is called Derek, but that's another story.
