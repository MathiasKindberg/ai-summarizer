Introduction\n\n1. With wisdom both ancient and new (cf. Mt. 13:52), we are called to reflect on the\ncurrent challenges and opportunities posed by scientific and technological\nadvancements, particularly by the recent development of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\nThe Christian tradition regards the gift of intelligence as an essential aspect of\nhow humans are created “in the image of God” (Gen. 1:27). Starting from an integral\nvision of the human person and the biblical calling to “till” and “keep” the earth\n(Gen. 2:15), the Church emphasizes that this gift of intelligence should be expressed\nthrough the responsible use of reason and technical abilities in the stewardship of\nthe created world.\n\n2. The Church encourages the advancement of science, technology, the arts, and other\nforms of human endeavor, viewing them as part of the “collaboration of man and woman\nwith God in perfecting the visible creation.” As Sirach affirms, God “gave\nskill to human beings, that he might be glorified in his marvelous works” (Sir.\n38:6). Human abilities and creativity come from God and, when used rightly, glorify\nGod by reflecting his wisdom and goodness. In light of this, when we ask ourselves\nwhat it means to “be human,” we cannot exclude a consideration of our scientific and\ntechnological abilities.\n\n3. It is within this perspective that the present *Note* addresses the\nanthropological and ethical challenges raised by AI—issues that are particularly\nsignificant, as one of the goals of this technology is *to imitate the human\nintelligence that designed it. *For instance, unlike many other human creations, AI\ncan be trained on the results of human creativity and then generate new “artifacts”\nwith a level of speed and skill that often rivals or surpasses what humans can do,\nsuch as producing text or images indistinguishable from human compositions. This\nraises critical concerns about AI’s potential role in the growing crisis of truth in\nthe public forum. Moreover, this technology is designed to learn and make certain\nchoices autonomously, adapting to new situations and providing solutions not foreseen\nby its programmers, and thus, it raises fundamental questions about ethical\nresponsibility and human safety, with broader implications for society as a whole.\nThis new situation has prompted many people to reflect on what it means to be human\nand the role of humanity in the world.\n\n4. Taking all this into account, there is broad consensus that AI marks a new and\nsignificant phase in humanity’s engagement with technology, placing it at the heart\nof what Pope Francis has described as an “epochal change.” Its impact is\nfelt globally and in a wide range of areas, including interpersonal relationships,\neducation, work, art, healthcare, law, warfare, and international relations. As AI\nadvances rapidly toward even greater achievements, it is critically important to\nconsider its anthropological and ethical implications. This involves not only\nmitigating risks and preventing harm but also ensuring that its applications are used\nto promote human progress and the common good.\n\n5. To contribute positively to the discernment regarding AI, and in response to Pope\nFrancis’ call for a renewed “wisdom of heart,” the Church offers its\nexperience through the anthropological and ethical reflections contained in this\n*Note*. Committed to its active role in the global dialogue on these issues, the\nChurch invites those entrusted with transmitting the faith—including parents,\nteachers, pastors, and bishops—to dedicate themselves to this critical subject with\ncare and attention. While this document is intended especially for them, it is also\nmeant to be accessible to a broader audience, particularly those who share the\nconviction that scientific and technological advances should be directed toward\nserving the human person and the common good.\n\n6. To this end, the document begins by distinguishing between concepts of\nintelligence in AI and in human intelligence. It then explores the Christian\nunderstanding of human intelligence, providing a framework rooted in the Church’s\nphilosophical and theological tradition. Finally, the document offers guidelines to\nensure that the development and use of AI uphold human dignity and promote the\nintegral development of the human person and society.\n\nII. What is Artificial Intelligence?\n\n7. The concept of “intelligence” in AI has evolved over time, drawing on a range of\nideas from various disciplines. While its origins extend back centuries, a\nsignificant milestone occurred in 1956 when the American computer scientist John\nMcCarthy organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth University to explore the problem\nof “Artificial Intelligence,” which he defined as “that of making a machine behave in\nways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving.”  This\nworkshop launched a research program focused on designing machines capable of\nperforming tasks typically associated with the human intellect and intelligent\nbehavior.\n\n8. Since then, AI research has advanced rapidly, leading to the development of\ncomplex systems capable of performing highly sophisticated tasks. These\nso-called “narrow AI” systems are typically designed to handle specific and limited\nfunctions, such as translating languages, predicting the trajectory of a storm,\nclassifying images, answering questions, or generating visual content at the user’s\nrequest. While the definition of “intelligence” in AI research varies, most\ncontemporary AI systems—particularly those using machine learning—rely on statistical\ninference rather than logical deduction. By analyzing large datasets to identify\npatterns, AI can “predict” outcomes and propose new approaches, mimicking\nsome cognitive processes typical of human problem-solving. Such achievements have\nbeen made possible through advances in computing technology (including neural\nnetworks, unsupervised machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms) as well as\nhardware innovations (such as specialized processors). Together, these technologies\nenable AI systems to respond to various forms of human input, adapt to new\nsituations, and even suggest novel solutions not anticipated by their original\nprogrammers.\n\n9. Due to these rapid advancements, many tasks once managed exclusively by humans are\nnow entrusted to AI. These systems can augment or even supersede what humans are able\nto do in many fields, particularly in specialized areas such as data analysis, image\nrecognition, and medical diagnosis. While each “narrow AI” application is designed\nfor a specific task, many researchers aspire to develop what is known as “Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence” (AGI)—a single system capable of operating across all cognitive\ndomains and performing any task within the scope of human intelligence. Some even\nargue that AGI could one day achieve the state of “superintelligence,” surpassing\nhuman intellectual capacities, or contribute to “super-longevity” through advances in\nbiotechnology. Others, however, fear that these possibilities, even if hypothetical,\ncould one day eclipse the human person, while still others welcome this potential\ntransformation.\n\n10. Underlying this and many other perspectives on the subject is the implicit\nassumption that the term “intelligence” can be used in the same way to refer to both\nhuman intelligence and AI. Yet, this does not capture the full scope of the concept.\nIn the case of humans, intelligence is a faculty that pertains to the person in his\nor her entirety, whereas in the context of AI, “intelligence” is understood\nfunctionally, often with the presumption that the activities characteristic of the\nhuman mind can be broken down into digitized steps that machines can\nreplicate.\n\n11. This functional perspective is exemplified by the “Turing Test,” which considers\na machine “intelligent” if a person cannot distinguish its behavior from that of a\nhuman. However, in this context, the term “behavior” refers only to the\nperformance of specific intellectual tasks; it does not account for the full breadth\nof human experience, which includes abstraction, emotions, creativity, and the\naesthetic, moral, and religious sensibilities. Nor does it encompass the full range\nof expressions characteristic of the human mind. Instead, in the case of AI, the\n“intelligence” of a system is evaluated methodologically, but also reductively, based\non its* ability to produce appropriate responses—in this case, those associated with\nthe human intellect—regardless of how those responses are generated*.\n\n12. AI’s advanced features give it sophisticated abilities to *perform tasks*, but\nnot the ability to *think*. This distinction is crucially important, as the\nway “intelligence” is defined inevitably shapes how we understand the relationship\nbetween human thought and this technology. To appreciate this, one must\nrecall the richness of the philosophical tradition and Christian theology, which\noffer a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of intelligence—an understanding\nthat is central to the Church’s teaching on the nature, dignity, and vocation of the\nhuman person.\n\nIII. Intelligence in the Philosophical and Theological Tradition\n\n*Rationality*\n\n13. From the dawn of human self-reflection, the mind has played a central role in\nunderstanding what it means to be “human.” Aristotle observed that “all people by\nnature desire to know.” This knowledge, with its capacity for abstraction\nthat grasps the nature and meaning of things, sets humans apart from the animal\nworld. As philosophers, theologians, and psychologists have examined the\nexact nature of this intellectual faculty, they have also explored how humans\nunderstand the world and their unique place within it. Through this exploration, the\nChristian tradition has come to understand the human person as a being consisting of\nboth body and soul—deeply connected to this world and yet transcending it.\n\n14. In the classical tradition, the concept of intelligence is often understood\nthrough the complementary concepts of “reason” (*ratio*) and “intellect”\n(*intellectus*). These are not separate faculties but, as Saint Thomas Aquinas\nexplains, they are two modes in which the same intelligence operates: “The term\n*intellect* is inferred from the inward grasp of the truth, while the name *reason*\nis taken from the inquisitive and discursive process.” This concise\ndescription highlights the two fundamental and complementary dimensions of human\nintelligence. *Intellectus* refers to the intuitive grasp of the truth—that is,\napprehending it with the “eyes” of the mind—which precedes and grounds argumentation\nitself. *Ratio* pertains to reasoning proper: the discursive, analytical process that\nleads to judgment. Together, intellect and reason form the two facets of the act of\n*intelligere*, “the proper operation of the human being as such.”\n\n15. Describing the human person as a “rational” being does not reduce the person to a\nspecific mode of thought; rather, it recognizes that the ability for intellectual\nunderstanding shapes and permeates all aspects of human activity.  Whether\nexercised well or poorly, this capacity is an intrinsic aspect of human nature. In\nthis sense, the “term ‘rational’ encompasses all the capacities of the human person,”\nincluding those related to “knowing and understanding, as well as those of willing,\nloving, choosing, and desiring; it also includes all corporeal functions closely\nrelated to these abilities.”  This comprehensive perspective underscores\nhow, in the human person, created in the “image of God,” reason is integrated in a\nway that elevates, shapes, and transforms both the person’s will and actions.\n\n\n*Embodiment*\n\n16. Christian thought considers the intellectual faculties of the human person within\nthe framework of an integral anthropology that views the human being as essentially\nembodied. In the human person, spirit and matter “are not two natures united, but\nrather their union forms a single nature.” In other words, the soul is not\nmerely the immaterial “part” of the person contained within the body, nor is the body\nan outer shell housing an intangible “core.” Rather, the entire human person is\nsimultaneously both material and spiritual. This understanding reflects the teaching\nof Sacred Scripture, which views the human person as a being who lives out\nrelationships with God and others (and thus, an authentically spiritual dimension)\nwithin and through this embodied existence. The profound meaning of this\ncondition is further illuminated by the mystery of the Incarnation, through which God\nhimself took on our flesh and “raised it up to a sublime dignity.”\n\n17. Although deeply rooted in bodily existence, the human person transcends the\nmaterial world through the soul, which is “almost on the horizon of eternity and\ntime.” The intellect's capacity for transcendence and the self-possessed\nfreedom of the will belong to the soul, by which the human person “shares in the\nlight of the divine mind.” Nevertheless, the human spirit does not exercise\nits normal mode of knowledge without the body. In this way, the\nintellectual faculties of the human person are an integral part of an anthropology\nthat recognizes that the human person is a “unity of body and soul.”\nFurther aspects of this understanding will be developed in what follows.\n\n*Relationality*\n\n18. Human beings are “ordered by their very nature to interpersonal\ncommunion,” possessing the capacity to know one another, to give themselves\nin love, and to enter into communion with others. Accordingly, human intelligence is\nnot an isolated faculty but is exercised in relationships, finding its fullest\nexpression in dialogue, collaboration, and solidarity. We learn with others, and we\nlearn through others.\n\n19. The relational orientation of the human person is ultimately grounded in the\neternal self-giving of the Triune God, whose love is revealed in creation and\nredemption. The human person is “called to share, by knowledge and love, in\nGod’s own life.”\n\n20. This vocation to communion with God is necessarily tied to the call to communion\nwith others. Love of God cannot be separated from love for one’s neighbor (cf. 1 Jn.\n4:20; Mt. 22:37-39). By the grace of sharing God’s life, Christians are also called\nto imitate Christ’s outpouring gift (cf. 2 Cor. 9:8-11; Eph. 5:1-2) by following his\ncommand to “love one another, as I have loved you” (Jn. 13:34). Love and\nservice, echoing the divine life of self-giving, transcend self-interest to respond\nmore fully to the human vocation (cf. 1 Jn. 2:9). Even more sublime than knowing many\nthings is the commitment to care for one another, for if “I understand all mysteries\nand all knowledge ... but do not have love, I am nothing” (1 Cor. 13:2).\n\n*Relationship with the Truth*\n\n21. Human intelligence is ultimately “God’s gift fashioned for the assimilation of\ntruth.”In the dual sense of *intellectus*-*ratio*, it enables the person to\nexplore realities that surpass mere sensory experience or utility, since “the desire\nfor truth is part of human nature itself. It is an innate property of human reason to\nask why things are as they are.” Moving beyond the limits of empirical\ndata, human intelligence can “with genuine certitude attain to reality itself as\nknowable.” While reality remains only partially known, the desire for truth\n“spurs reason always to go further; indeed, it is as if reason were overwhelmed to\nsee that it can always go beyond what it has already achieved.” Although\nTruth in itself transcends the boundaries of human intelligence, it irresistibly\nattracts it. Drawn by this attraction, the human person is led to seek\n“truths of a higher order.”\n\n22. This innate drive toward the pursuit of truth is especially evident in the\ndistinctly human capacities for semantic understanding and creativity,\nthrough which this search unfolds in a “manner that is appropriate to the social\nnature and dignity of the human person.” Likewise, a steadfast orientation\nto the truth is essential for charity to be both authentic and universal.\n\n23. The search for truth finds its highest expression in openness to realities that\ntranscend the physical and created world. In God, all truths attain their ultimate\nand original meaning. Entrusting oneself to God is a “fundamental decision\nthat engages the whole person.” In this way, the human person becomes fully\nwhat he or she is called to be: “the intellect and the will display their spiritual\nnature,” enabling the person “to act in a way that realizes personal freedom to the\nfull.”\n\n*Stewardship of the World*\n\n24. The Christian faith understands creation as the free act of the Triune God, who,\nas Saint Bonaventure of Bagnoregio explains, creates “not to increase his glory, but\nto show it forth and to communicate it.” Since God creates according to his\nWisdom (cf. Wis. 9:9; Jer. 10:12), creation is imbued with an intrinsic order that\nreflects God’s plan (cf. Gen. 1; Dan. 2:21-22; Is. 45:18; Ps. 74:12-17;\n104), within which God has called human beings to assume a unique role:\n*to* *cultivate and care for the world*.\n\n25. Shaped by the Divine Craftsman, humans live out their identity as beings made *in\nimago Dei* by “keeping” and “tilling” (cf. Gen. 2:15) creation—using their\nintelligence and skills to care for and develop creation in accord with God’s\nplan. In this, human intelligence reflects the Divine Intelligence that\ncreated all things (cf. Gen. 1-2; Jn. 1), continuously sustains them, and\nguides them to their ultimate purpose in him. Moreover, human beings are\ncalled to develop their abilities in science and technology, for through them, God is\nglorified (cf*. *Sir.* * 38:6). Thus, in a proper relationship with creation, humans,\non the one hand, use their intelligence and skill to cooperate with God in guiding\ncreation toward the purpose to which he has called it. On the other hand,\ncreation itself, as Saint Bonaventure observes, helps the human mind to “ascend\ngradually to the supreme Principle, who is God.”\n\n*An Integral Understanding of Human Intelligence*\n\n26. In this context, human intelligence becomes more clearly understood as a faculty\nthat forms an integral part of how the whole person engages with reality. Authentic\nengagement requires embracing the full scope of one’s being: spiritual, cognitive,\nembodied, and relational.\n\n27. This engagement with reality unfolds in various ways, as each person, in his or\nher multifaceted individuality, seeks to understand the world, relate to\nothers, solve problems, express creativity, and pursue integral well-being through\nthe harmonious interplay of the various dimensions of the person’s\nintelligence. This involves logical and linguistic abilities but can also\nencompass other modes of interacting with reality. Consider the work of an artisan,\nwho “must know how to discern, in inert matter, a particular form that others cannot\nrecognize” and bring it forth through insight and practical skill.\nIndigenous peoples who live close to the earth often possess a profound sense of\nnature and its cycles. Similarly, a friend who knows the right word to say\nor a person adept at managing human relationships exemplifies an intelligence that is\n“the fruit of self-examination, dialogue and generous encounter between\npersons.” As Pope Francis observes, “in this age of artificial\nintelligence, we cannot forget that poetry and love are necessary to save our\nhumanity.”\n\n28. At the heart of the Christian understanding of intelligence is the integration of\ntruth into the moral and spiritual life of the person, guiding his or her actions in\nlight of God’s goodness and truth. According to God’s plan, intelligence, in its\nfullest sense, also includes the ability to savor what is true, good, and beautiful.\nAs the twentieth-century French poet Paul Claudel expressed, “intelligence is nothing\nwithout delight.” Similarly, Dante, upon reaching the highest heaven in\n*Paradiso*, testifies that the culmination of this intellectual delight is found in\nthe “light intellectual full of love, love of true good filled with joy, joy which\ntranscends every sweetness.”\n\n29. A proper understanding of human intelligence, therefore, cannot be reduced to the\nmere acquisition of facts or the ability to perform specific tasks. Instead, it\ninvolves the person’s openness to the ultimate questions of life and reflects an\norientation toward the True and the Good. As an expression of the divine\nimage within the person, human intelligence has the ability to access the totality of\nbeing, contemplating existence in its fullness, which goes beyond what is measurable,\nand grasping the meaning of what has been understood. For believers, this capacity\nincludes, in a particular way, the ability to grow in the knowledge of the mysteries\nof God by using reason to engage ever more profoundly with revealed truths\n(*intellectus fidei*). True intelligence is shaped by divine love, which\n“is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit” (Rom. 5:5). From this, it follows\nthat human intelligence possesses an essential *contemplative *dimension, an\nunselfish openness to the True, the Good, and the Beautiful, beyond any utilitarian\npurpose.\n\n*The Limits of AI*\n\n30. In light of the foregoing discussion, the differences between human intelligence\nand current AI systems become evident. While AI is an extraordinary technological\nachievement capable of imitating certain outputs associated with human intelligence,\nit operates by performing tasks, achieving goals, or making decisions based on\nquantitative data and computational logic. For example, with its analytical power, AI\nexcels at integrating data from a variety of fields, modeling complex systems, and\nfostering interdisciplinary connections. In this way, it can help experts collaborate\nin solving complex problems that “cannot be dealt with from a single perspective or\nfrom a single set of interests.”\n\n31. However, even as AI processes and simulates certain expressions of intelligence,\nit remains fundamentally confined to a logical-mathematical framework, which imposes\ninherent limitations. Human intelligence, in contrast, develops organically\nthroughout the person’s physical and psychological growth, shaped by a myriad of\nlived experiences in the flesh. Although advanced AI systems can “learn” through\nprocesses such as machine learning, this sort of training is fundamentally different\nfrom the developmental growth of human intelligence, which is shaped by embodied\nexperiences, including sensory input, emotional responses, social interactions, and\nthe unique context of each moment. These elements shape and form individuals within\ntheir personal history.In contrast, AI, lacking a physical body, relies on\ncomputational reasoning and learning based on vast datasets that include recorded\nhuman experiences and knowledge.\n\n32. Consequently, although AI can simulate aspects of human reasoning and perform\nspecific tasks with incredible speed and efficiency, its computational abilities\nrepresent only a fraction of the broader capacities of the human mind. For instance,\nAI cannot currently replicate moral discernment or the ability to establish authentic\nrelationships. Moreover, human intelligence is situated within a personally lived\nhistory of intellectual and moral formation that fundamentally shapes the\nindividual’s perspective, encompassing the physical, emotional, social, moral, and\nspiritual dimensions of life. Since AI cannot offer this fullness of understanding,\napproaches that rely solely on this technology or treat it as the primary means of\ninterpreting the world can lead to “a loss of appreciation for the whole, for the\nrelationships between things, and for the broader horizon.”\n\n33. Human intelligence is not primarily about completing functional tasks but about\nunderstanding and actively engaging with reality in all its dimensions; it is also\ncapable of surprising insights. Since AI lacks the richness of corporeality,\nrelationality, and the openness of the human heart to truth and goodness, its\ncapacities—though seemingly limitless—are incomparable with the human ability to\ngrasp reality. So much can be learned from an illness, an embrace of reconciliation,\nand even a simple sunset; indeed, many experiences we have as humans open new\nhorizons and offer the possibility of attaining new wisdom. No device, working solely\nwith data, can measure up to these and countless other experiences present in our\nlives.\n\n34. Drawing an overly close equivalence between human intelligence and AI risks\nsuccumbing to a functionalist perspective, where people are valued based on the work\nthey can perform. However, a person’s worth does not depend on possessing specific\nskills, cognitive and technological achievements, or individual success, but on the\nperson’s inherent dignity, grounded in being created in the image of God.\nThis dignity remains intact in all circumstances, including for those unable to\nexercise their abilities, whether it be an unborn child, an unconscious person, or an\nolder person who is suffering.  It also underpins the tradition of human\nrights (and, in particular, what are now called “neuro-rights”), which represent “an\nimportant point of convergence in the search for common ground” and can,\nthus, serve as a fundamental ethical guide in discussions on the responsible\ndevelopment and use of AI.\n\n35. Considering all these points, as Pope Francis observes, “the very use of the word\n‘intelligence’” in connection with AI “can prove misleading” and risks\noverlooking what is most precious in the human person. In light of this, AI should\nnot be seen as *an artificial form *of* *human intelligence but as* a product *of*\n*it.\n\nIV. The Role of Ethics in Guiding the Development and Use of AI\n\n36. Given these considerations, one can ask how AI can be understood within God’s\nplan. To answer this, it is important to recall that techno-scientific activity is\nnot neutral in character but is a *human * endeavor that engages the humanistic and\ncultural dimensions of human creativity.\n\n37. Seen as a fruit of the potential inscribed within human intelligence,\nscientific inquiry and the development of technical skills are part of the\n“collaboration of man and woman with God in perfecting the visible\ncreation.” At the same time, all scientific and technological achievements\nare, ultimately, gifts from God. Therefore, human beings must always use\ntheir abilities in view of the higher purpose for which God has granted\nthem.\n\n38. We can gratefully acknowledge how technology has “remedied countless evils which\nused to harm and limit human beings,” a fact for which we should rejoice.\nNevertheless, not all technological advancements in themselves represent genuine\nhuman progress. The Church is particularly opposed to those applications\nthat threaten the sanctity of life or the dignity of the human person. Like\nany human endeavor, technological development must be directed to serve the human\nperson and contribute to the pursuit of “greater justice, more extensive fraternity,\nand a more humane order of social relations,” which are “more valuable than advances\nin the technical field.” Concerns about the ethical implications of\ntechnological development are shared not only within the Church but also among many\nscientists, technologists, and professional associations, who increasingly call for\nethical reflection to guide this development in a responsible way.\n\n39. To address these challenges, it is essential to emphasize *the importance of\nmoral responsibility grounded in the dignity and vocation of the human person*. This\nguiding principle also applies to questions concerning AI. In this context, the\nethical dimension takes on primary importance because it is people who design systems\nand determine the purposes for which they are used. Between a machine and a\nhuman being, only the latter is truly a moral agent—a subject of moral responsibility\nwho exercises freedom in his or her decisions and accepts their\nconsequences. It is not the machine but the human who is in relationship\nwith truth and goodness, guided by a moral conscience that calls the person “to love\nand to do what is good and to avoid evil,” bearing witness to “the\nauthority of truth in reference to the supreme Good to which the human person is\ndrawn.” Likewise, between a machine and a human, only the human can be\nsufficiently self-aware to the point of listening and following the voice of\nconscience, discerning with prudence, and seeking the good that is possible in every\nsituation. In fact, all of this also belongs to the person’s exercise of\nintelligence.\n\n40. Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or\nnegative ends. When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the\nwell-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human\nvocation. Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow\nof evil also looms here. Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing\nwhat is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account\nhow it is directed and used.\n\n41. At the same time, it is not only the ends that are ethically significant but also\nthe means employed to achieve them. Additionally, the overall vision and\nunderstanding of the human person embedded within these systems are important to\nconsider as well. Technological products reflect the worldview of their developers,\nowners, users, and regulators, and have the power to “shape the world and\nengage consciences on the level of values.” On a societal level, some\ntechnological developments could also reinforce relationships and power dynamics that\nare inconsistent with a proper understanding of the human person and society.\n\n42. Therefore, the ends and the means used in a given application of AI, as well as\nthe overall vision it incorporates, must all be evaluated to ensure they respect\nhuman dignity and promote the common good. As Pope Francis has stated, “the\nintrinsic dignity of every man and every woman” must be “the key criterion in\nevaluating emerging technologies; these will prove ethically sound to the extent that\nthey help respect that dignity and increase its expression at every level of human\nlife,” including in the social and economic spheres. In this sense, human\nintelligence plays a crucial role not only in designing and producing technology but\nalso in directing its use in line with the authentic good of the human\nperson. The responsibility for managing this wisely pertains to every\nlevel of society, guided by the principle of subsidiarity and other principles of\nCatholic Social Teaching.\n\n*Helping Human Freedom and Decision-Making*\n\n43. The commitment to ensuring that *AI always supports and promotes the supreme\nvalue of the dignity of every human being and the fullness of the human vocation*\nserves as a criterion of discernment for developers, owners, operators, and\nregulators of AI, as well as to its users. It remains valid for every application of\nthe technology at every level of its use.\n\n44. An evaluation of the implications of this guiding principle could begin by\nconsidering the importance of *moral responsibility. *Since full moral causality\nbelongs only to * personal* agents, not artificial ones, it is crucial to be able to\nidentify and define who bears responsibility for the processes involved in AI,\nparticularly those capable of learning, correction, and reprogramming. While\nbottom-up approaches and very deep neural networks enable AI to solve complex\nproblems, they make it difficult to understand the processes that lead to the\nsolutions they adopted. This complicates accountability since if an AI application\nproduces undesired outcomes, determining who is responsible becomes difficult. To\naddress this problem, attention needs to be given to the nature of *accountability\n*processes in complex, highly automated settings, where results may only become\nevident in the medium to long term. For this, it is important that ultimate\nresponsibility for decisions made using AI rests with the human decision-makers and\nthat there is accountability for the use of AI at each stage of the decision-making\nprocess.\n\n45. In addition to determining who is responsible, it is essential to identify the\nobjectives given to AI systems. Although these systems may use unsupervised\nautonomous learning mechanisms and sometimes follow paths that humans cannot\nreconstruct, they ultimately pursue goals that humans have assigned to them and are\ngoverned by processes established by their designers and programmers. Yet, this\npresents a challenge because, as AI models become increasingly capable of independent\nlearning, the ability to maintain control over them to ensure that such applications\nserve human purposes may effectively diminish. This raises the critical question of\nhow to ensure that AI systems are ordered for the good of people and not against\nthem.\n\n46. While responsibility for the ethical use of AI systems starts with those who\ndevelop, produce, manage, and oversee such systems, it is also shared by those who\nuse them. As Pope Francis noted, the machine “makes a technical choice among several\npossibilities based either on well-defined criteria or on statistical inferences.\nHuman beings, however, not only choose, but in their hearts are capable of\ndeciding.” Those who use AI to accomplish a task and follow its results\ncreate a context in which they are ultimately responsible for the power they have\ndelegated. Therefore, insofar as AI can assist humans in making decisions, the\nalgorithms that govern it should be trustworthy, secure, robust enough to handle\ninconsistencies, and transparent in their operation to mitigate biases and unintended\nside effects. Regulatory frameworks should ensure that all legal entities\nremain accountable for the use of AI and all its consequences, with appropriate\nsafeguards for transparency, privacy, and accountability. Moreover, those\nusing AI should be careful not to become overly dependent on it for their\ndecision-making, a trend that increases contemporary society’s already high reliance\non technology.\n\n47. The Church’s moral and social teaching provides resources to help ensure that AI\nis used in a way that preserves human agency. Considerations about justice, for\nexample, should also address issues such as fostering just social dynamics, upholding\ninternational security, and promoting peace. By exercising prudence, individuals and\ncommunities can discern ways to use AI to benefit humanity while avoiding\napplications that could degrade human dignity or harm the environment. In this\ncontext, the concept of responsibility should be understood not only in its most\nlimited sense but as a “responsibility for the care for others, which is more than\nsimply accounting for results achieved.”\n\n48. Therefore, AI, like any technology, can be part of a conscious and responsible\nanswer to humanity’s vocation to the good. However, as previously discussed, AI must\nbe directed by human intelligence* *to align with this vocation, ensuring it respects\nthe dignity of the human person. Recognizing this “exalted dignity,” the Second\nVatican Council affirmed that “the social order and its development must invariably\nwork to the benefit of the human person.” In light of this, the use of AI,\nas Pope Francis said, must be “accompanied by an ethic inspired by a vision of the\ncommon good, an ethic of freedom, responsibility, and fraternity, capable of\nfostering the full development of people in relation to others and to the whole of\ncreation.”\n\nV. Specific Questions\n\n49. Within this general perspective, some observations follow below to illustrate how\nthe preceding arguments can help provide an ethical orientation in practical\nsituations, in line with the “wisdom of heart” that Pope Francis has\nproposed. While not exhaustive, this discussion is offered in service of\nthe dialogue that considers how AI can be used to uphold the dignity of the human\nperson and promote the common good.\n\n*AI and Society*\n\n50. As Pope Francis observed, “the inherent dignity of each human being and the\nfraternity that binds us together as members of the one human family must undergird\nthe development of new technologies and serve as indisputable criteria for evaluating\nthem before they are employed.”\n\n51. Viewed through this lens, AI could “introduce important innovations in\nagriculture, education and culture, an improved level of life for entire nations and\npeoples, and the growth of human fraternity and social friendship,” and thus be “used\nto promote integral human development.” AI could also help organizations\nidentify those in need and counter discrimination and marginalization. These and\nother similar applications of this technology could contribute to human development\nand the common good.\n\n52. However, while AI holds many possibilities for promoting the good, it can also\nhinder or even counter human development and the common good. Pope Francis has noted\nthat “evidence to date suggests that digital technologies have increased inequality\nin our world. Not just differences in material wealth, which are also significant,\nbut also differences in access to political and social influence.” In\nthis sense, AI could be used to perpetuate marginalization and discrimination, create\nnew forms of poverty, widen the “digital divide,” and worsen existing social\ninequalities.\n\n53. Moreover, the concentration of the power over mainstream AI applications in the\nhands of a few powerful companies raises significant ethical concerns. Exacerbating\nthis problem is the inherent nature of AI systems, where no single individual can\nexercise complete oversight over the vast and complex datasets used for computation.\nThis lack of well-defined accountability creates the risk that AI could be\nmanipulated for personal or corporate gain or to direct public opinion for the\nbenefit of a specific industry. Such entities, motivated by their own interests,\npossess the capacity to exercise “forms of control as subtle as they are invasive,\ncreating mechanisms for the manipulation of consciences and of the democratic\nprocess.”\n\n54. Furthermore, there is the risk of AI being used to promote what Pope Francis has\ncalled the “technocratic paradigm,” which perceives all the world’s problems as\nsolvable through technological means alone. In this paradigm, human\ndignity and fraternity are often set aside in the name of efficiency, “as if reality,\ngoodness, and truth automatically flow from technological and economic power as\nsuch.” Yet, human dignity and the common good must never be violated for\nthe sake of efficiency, for “technological developments that do not lead\nto an improvement in the quality of life of all humanity, but on the contrary,\naggravate inequalities and conflicts, can never count as true progress.”\nInstead, AI should be put “at the service of another type of progress, one which is\nhealthier, more human, more social, more integral.”\n\n55. Achieving this objective requires a deeper reflection on the relationship between\nautonomy and responsibility. Greater autonomy heightens each person’s responsibility\nacross various aspects of communal life. For Christians, the foundation of this\nresponsibility lies in the recognition that all human capacities, including the\nperson’s autonomy, come from God and are meant to be used in the service of\nothers. Therefore, rather than merely pursuing economic or technological\nobjectives, AI should serve “the common good of the entire human family,” which is\n“the sum total of social conditions that allow people, either as groups or as\nindividuals, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily.”\n\n*AI and Human Relationships*\n\n56. The Second Vatican Council observed that “by his innermost nature man is a social\nbeing; and if he does not enter into relations with others, he can neither live nor\ndevelop his gifts.” This conviction underscores that living in society is\nintrinsic to the nature and vocation of the human person. As social\nbeings, we seek relationships that involve mutual exchange and the pursuit of truth,\nin the course of which, people “share with each other the truth they have discovered,\nor think they have discovered, in such a way that they help one another in the search\nfor truth.”\n\n57. Such a quest, along with other aspects of human communication, presupposes\nencounters and mutual exchange between individuals shaped by their unique histories,\nthoughts, convictions, and relationships. Nor can we forget that human intelligence\nis a diverse, multifaceted, and complex reality: individual and social, rational and\naffective, conceptual and symbolic. Pope Francis underscores this dynamic, noting\nthat “together, we can seek the truth in dialogue, in relaxed conversation or in\npassionate debate. To do so calls for perseverance; it entails moments of silence and\nsuffering, yet it can patiently embrace the broader experience of individuals and\npeoples. … The process of building fraternity, be it local or universal, can only\nbe undertaken by spirits that are free and open to authentic encounters.”\n\n58. It is in this context that one can consider the challenges AI poses to human\nrelationships. Like other technological tools, AI has the potential to foster\nconnections within the human family. However, it could also hinder a true encounter\nwith reality and, ultimately, lead people to “a deep and melancholic dissatisfaction\nwith interpersonal relations, or a harmful sense of isolation.” Authentic\nhuman relationships require the richness of being with others in their pain, their\npleas, and their joy. Since human intelligence is expressed and enriched\nalso in interpersonal and embodied ways, authentic and spontaneous encounters with\nothers are indispensable for engaging with reality in its fullness.\n\n59. Because “true wisdom demands an encounter with reality,” the rise of\nAI introduces another challenge. Since AI can effectively imitate the products of\nhuman intelligence, the ability to know when one is interacting with a human or a\nmachine can no longer be taken for granted. Generative AI can produce text, speech,\nimages, and other advanced outputs that are usually associated with human beings.\nYet, it must be understood for what it is: a tool, not a person. This\ndistinction is often obscured by the language used by practitioners, which tends to\nanthropomorphize AI and thus blurs the line between human and machine.\n\n60. Anthropomorphizing AI also poses specific challenges for the development of\nchildren, potentially encouraging them to develop patterns of interaction that treat\nhuman relationships in a transactional manner, as one would relate to a chatbot. Such\nhabits could lead young people to see teachers as mere dispensers of information\nrather than as mentors who guide and nurture their intellectual and moral growth.\nGenuine relationships, rooted in empathy and a steadfast commitment to the good of\nthe other, are essential and irreplaceable in fostering the full development of the\nhuman person.\n\n61. In this context, it is important to clarify that, despite the use of\nanthropomorphic language, no AI application can genuinely experience empathy.\nEmotions cannot be reduced to facial expressions or phrases generated in response to\nprompts; they reflect the way a person, as a whole, relates to the world and to his\nor her own life, with the body playing a central role. True empathy requires the\nability to listen, recognize another’s irreducible uniqueness, welcome their\notherness, and grasp the meaning behind even their silences. Unlike the\nrealm of analytical judgment in which AI excels, true empathy belongs to the\nrelational sphere. It involves intuiting and apprehending the lived experiences of\nanother while maintaining the distinction between self and other. While\nAI can simulate empathetic responses, it cannot replicate the eminently personal and\nrelational nature of authentic empathy.\n\n62. In light of the above, it is clear why misrepresenting AI as a person should\nalways be avoided; doing so for fraudulent purposes is a grave ethical violation that\ncould erode social trust. Similarly, using AI to deceive in other contexts—such as in\neducation or in human relationships, including the sphere of sexuality—is also to be\nconsidered immoral and requires careful oversight to prevent harm, maintain\ntransparency, and ensure the dignity of all people.\n\n63. In an increasingly isolated world, some people have turned to AI in search of\ndeep human relationships, simple companionship, or even emotional bonds. However,\nwhile human beings are meant to experience authentic relationships, AI can only\nsimulate them. Nevertheless, such relationships with others are an integral part of\nhow a person grows to become who he or she is meant to be. If AI is used to help\npeople foster genuine connections between people, it can contribute positively to the\nfull realization of the person. Conversely, if we replace relationships with God and\nwith others with interactions with technology, we risk replacing authentic\nrelationality with a lifeless image (cf. Ps. 106:20; Rom. 1:22-23). Instead of\nretreating into artificial worlds, we are called to engage in a committed and\nintentional way with reality, especially by identifying with the poor and suffering,\nconsoling those in sorrow, and forging bonds of communion with all.\n\n*AI, the Economy, and Labor*\n\n64. Due to its interdisciplinary nature, AI is being increasingly integrated into\neconomic and financial systems. Significant investments are currently being made not\nonly in the technology sector but also in energy, finance, and media, particularly in\nthe areas of marketing and sales, logistics, technological innovation, compliance,\nand risk management. At the same time, AI’s applications in these areas have also\nhighlighted its ambivalent nature, as a source of tremendous opportunities but also\nprofound risks. A first real critical point in this area concerns the possibility\nthat—due to the concentration of AI applications in the hands of a few\ncorporations—only those large companies would benefit from the value created by AI\nrather than the businesses that use it.\n\n65. Other broader aspects of AI’s impact on the economic-financial sphere must also\nbe carefully examined, particularly concerning the interaction between concrete\nreality and the digital world. One important consideration in this regard involves\nthe coexistence of diverse and alternative forms of economic and financial\ninstitutions within a given context. This factor should be encouraged, as it can\nbring benefits in how it supports the real economy by fostering its development and\nstability, especially during times of crisis. Nevertheless, it should be stressed\nthat digital realities, not restricted by any spatial bonds, tend to be more\nhomogeneous and impersonal than communities rooted in a particular place and a\nspecific history, with a common journey characterized by shared values and hopes, but\nalso by inevitable disagreements and divergences. This diversity is an undeniable\nasset to a community’s economic life. Turning over the economy and finance entirely\nto digital technology would reduce this variety and richness. As a result, many\nsolutions to economic problems that can be reached through natural dialogue between\nthe involved parties may no longer be attainable in a world dominated by procedures\nand only the appearance of nearness.\n\n66. Another area where AI is already having a profound impact is the world of work.\nAs in many other fields, AI is driving fundamental transformations across many\nprofessions, with a range of effects. On the one hand, it has the potential to\nenhance expertise and productivity, create new jobs, enable workers to focus on more\ninnovative tasks, and open new horizons for creativity and innovation.\n\n67. However, while AI promises to boost productivity by taking over mundane tasks, it\nfrequently forces workers to adapt to the speed and demands of machines rather than\nmachines being designed to support those who work. As a result, contrary to the\nadvertised benefits of AI, current approaches to the technology can paradoxically\n*deskill* workers, subject them to automated surveillance, and relegate them to rigid\nand repetitive tasks. The need to keep up with the pace of technology can erode\nworkers’ sense of agency and stifle the innovative abilities they are expected to\nbring to their work.\n\n68. AI is currently eliminating the need for some jobs that were once performed by\nhumans. If AI is used to replace human workers rather than complement them, there is\na “substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the\nimpoverishment of many.” Additionally, as AI becomes more powerful, there\nis an associated risk that human labor may lose its value in the economic realm. This\nis the logical consequence of the technocratic paradigm: a world of humanity enslaved\nto efficiency, where, ultimately, the cost of humanity must be cut. Yet, human lives\nare intrinsically valuable, independent of their economic output. Nevertheless, the\n“current model,” Pope Francis explains, “does not appear to favor an investment in\nefforts to help the slow, the weak, or the less talented to find opportunities in\nlife.” In light of this, “we cannot allow a tool as powerful and\nindispensable as Artificial Intelligence to reinforce such a paradigm, but rather, we\nmust make Artificial Intelligence a bulwark against its expansion.” \n\n69. It is important to remember that “the order of things must be subordinate to the\norder of persons, and not the other way around.” Human work must not only\nbe at the service of profit but at “the service of the whole human person … taking\ninto account the person’s material needs and the requirements of his or her\nintellectual, moral, spiritual, and religious life.” In this context, the\nChurch recognizes that work is “not only a means of earning one’s daily bread” but is\nalso “an essential dimension of social life” and “a means … of personal growth, the\nbuilding of healthy relationships, self-expression and the exchange of gifts. Work\ngives us a sense of shared responsibility for the development of the world, and\nultimately, for our life as a people.”\n\n70. Since work is a “part of the meaning of life on this earth, a path to growth,\nhuman development and personal fulfillment,” “the goal should not be that\ntechnological progress increasingly replaces human work, for this would be\ndetrimental to humanity”—rather, it should promote human labor. Seen in\nthis light, AI should assist, not replace, human judgment. Similarly, it must never\ndegrade creativity or reduce workers to mere “cogs in a machine.” Therefore, “respect\nfor the dignity of laborers and the importance of employment for the economic\nwell-being of individuals, families, and societies, for job security and just wages,\nought to be a high priority for the international community as these forms of\ntechnology penetrate more deeply into our workplaces.”\n\n*AI and Healthcare*\n\n71. As participants in God’s healing work, healthcare professionals have the vocation\nand responsibility to be “guardians and servants of human life.” Because\nof this, the healthcare profession carries an “intrinsic and undeniable ethical\ndimension,” recognized by the Hippocratic Oath, which obliges physicians and\nhealthcare professionals to commit themselves to having “absolute respect for human\nlife and its sacredness.” Following the example of the Good Samaritan,\nthis commitment is to be carried out by men and women “who reject the creation of a\nsociety of exclusion, and act instead as neighbors, lifting up and rehabilitating the\nfallen for the sake of the common good.”\n\n72. Seen in this light, AI seems to hold immense potential in a variety of\napplications in the medical field, such as assisting the diagnostic work of\nhealthcare providers, facilitating relationships between patients and medical staff,\noffering new treatments, and expanding access to quality care also for those who are\nisolated or marginalized. In these ways, the technology could enhance the\n“compassionate and loving closeness” that healthcare providers are called\nto extend to the sick and suffering.\n\n73. However, if AI is used not to enhance but to replace the relationship between\npatients and healthcare providers—leaving patients to interact with a machine rather\nthan a human being—it would reduce a crucially important human relational structure\nto a centralized, impersonal, and unequal framework. Instead of encouraging\nsolidarity with the sick and suffering, such applications of AI would risk worsening\nthe loneliness that often accompanies illness, especially in the context of a culture\nwhere “persons are no longer seen as a paramount value to be cared for and\nrespected.” This misuse of AI would not align with respect for the\ndignity of the human person and solidarity with the suffering.\n\n74. Responsibility for the well-being of patients and the decisions that touch upon\ntheir lives are at the heart of the healthcare profession. This accountability\nrequires medical professionals to exercise all their skill and intelligence in making\nwell-reasoned and ethically grounded choices regarding those entrusted to their care,\nalways respecting the inviolable dignity of the patients and the need for informed\nconsent. As a result, decisions regarding patient treatment and the weight of\nresponsibility they entail must always remain with the human person and should never\nbe delegated to AI.\n\n75. In addition, using AI to determine who should receive treatment based\npredominantly on economic measures or metrics of efficiency represents a particularly\nproblematic instance of the “technocratic paradigm” that must be\nrejected. For, “optimizing resources means using them in an ethical and\nfraternal way, and not penalizing the most fragile.” Additionally, AI\ntools in healthcare are “exposed to forms of bias and discrimination,” where\n“systemic errors can easily multiply, producing not only injustices in individual\ncases but also, due to the domino effect, real forms of social\ninequality.”\n\n76. The integration of AI into healthcare also poses the risk of amplifying other\nexisting disparities in access to medical care. As healthcare becomes increasingly\noriented toward prevention and lifestyle-based approaches, AI-driven solutions may\ninadvertently favor more affluent populations who already enjoy better access to\nmedical resources and quality nutrition. This trend risks reinforcing a “medicine for\nthe rich” model, where those with financial means benefit from advanced preventative\ntools and personalized health information while others struggle to access even basic\nservices. To prevent such inequities, equitable frameworks are needed to ensure that\nthe use of AI in healthcare does not worsen existing healthcare inequalities but\nrather serves the common good.\n\n*AI and Education*\n\n77. The words of the Second Vatican Council remain fully relevant today: “True\neducation strives to form individuals with a view toward their final end and the good\nof the society to which they belong.” As such, education is “never a mere\nprocess of passing on facts and intellectual skills: rather, its aim is to contribute\nto the person’s holistic formation in its various aspects (intellectual, cultural,\nspiritual, etc.), including, for example, community life and relations within the\nacademic community,” in keeping with the nature and dignity of the human\nperson.\n\n78. This approach involves a commitment to cultivating the mind, but always as a part\nof the integral development of the person: “We must break that idea of education\nwhich holds that educating means filling one’s head with ideas. That is the way we\neducate automatons, cerebral minds, not people. Educating is taking a risk in the\ntension between the mind, the heart, and the hands.”\n\n79. At the center of this work of forming the whole human person is the indispensable\nrelationship between teacher and student. Teachers do more than convey knowledge;\nthey model essential human qualities and inspire the joy of discovery.\nTheir presence motivates students both through the content they teach and the care\nthey demonstrate for their students. This bond fosters trust, mutual understanding,\nand the capacity to address each person’s unique dignity and potential. On the part\nof the student, this can generate a genuine desire to grow. The physical presence of\na teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate, one that deepens\nengagement and nurtures the student’s integral development.\n\n80. In this context, AI presents both opportunities and challenges. If used in a\nprudent manner, within the context of an existing teacher-student relationship and\nordered to the authentic goals of education, AI can become a valuable educational\nresource by enhancing access to education, offering tailored support, and providing\nimmediate feedback to students. These benefits could enhance the learning experience,\nespecially in cases where individualized attention is needed, or educational\nresources are otherwise scarce.\n\n81. Nevertheless, an essential part of education is forming “the intellect to reason\nwell in all matters, to reach out towards truth, and to grasp it,” while\nhelping the “language of the head” to grow harmoniously with the “language of the\nheart” and the “language of the hands.” This is all the more vital in an\nage marked by technology, in which “it is no longer merely a question of ‘using’\ninstruments of communication, but of living in a highly digitalized culture that has\nhad a profound impact on … our ability to communicate, learn, be informed and enter\ninto relationship with others.” However, instead of fostering “a\ncultivated intellect,” which “brings with it a power and a grace to every work and\noccupation that it undertakes,” the extensive use of AI in education\ncould lead to the students’ increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability\nto perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on\nscreens.\n\n82. Additionally, while some AI systems are designed to help people develop their\ncritical thinking abilities and problem-solving skills, many others merely provide\nanswers instead of prompting students to arrive at answers themselves or write text\nfor themselves. Instead of training young people how to amass information\nand generate quick responses, education should encourage “the responsible use of\nfreedom to face issues with good sense and intelligence.” Building on\nthis, “education in the use of forms of artificial intelligence should aim above all\nat promoting critical thinking. Users of all ages, but especially the young, need to\ndevelop a discerning approach to the use of data and content collected on the web or\nproduced by artificial intelligence systems. Schools, universities, and scientific\nsocieties are challenged to help students and professionals to grasp the social and\nethical aspects of the development and uses of technology.”\n\n83. As Saint John Paul II recalled, “in the world today, characterized by such rapid\ndevelopments in science and technology, the tasks of a Catholic University assume an\never greater importance and urgency.” In a particular way, Catholic\nuniversities are urged to be present as great laboratories of hope at this crossroads\nof history. In an inter-disciplinary and cross-disciplinary key, they are urged to\nengage “with wisdom and creativity” in careful research on this\nphenomenon, helping to draw out the salutary potential within the various fields of\nscience and reality, and guiding them always towards ethically sound applications\nthat clearly serve the cohesion of our societies and the common good, reaching new\nfrontiers in the dialogue between faith and reason.\n\n84. Moreover, it should be noted that current AI programs have been known to provide\nbiased or fabricated information, which can lead students to trust inaccurate\ncontent. This problem “not only runs the risk of legitimizing fake news and\nstrengthening a dominant culture’s advantage, but, in short, it also undermines the\neducational process itself.” With time, clearer distinctions may emerge\nbetween proper and improper uses of AI in education and research. Yet, a decisive\nguideline is that the use of AI should always be transparent and never\nmisrepresented.\n\n*AI, Misinformation, Deepfakes, and Abuse*\n\n85. AI could be used as an aid to human dignity if it helps people understand complex\nconcepts or directs them to sound resources that support their search for the\ntruth.\n\n86. However, AI also presents a serious risk of generating manipulated content and\nfalse information, which can easily mislead people due to its resemblance to the\ntruth. Such misinformation might occur unintentionally, as in the case of AI\n“hallucination,” where a generative AI system yields results that appear real but are\nnot. Since generating content that mimics human artifacts is central to AI’s\nfunctionality, mitigating these risks proves challenging. Yet, the consequences of\nsuch aberrations and false information can be quite grave. For this reason, all those\ninvolved in producing and using AI systems should be committed to the truthfulness\nand accuracy of the information processed by such systems and disseminated to the\npublic.\n\n87. While AI has a latent potential to generate false information, an even more\ntroubling problem lies in the deliberate misuse of AI for manipulation. This can\noccur when individuals or organizations intentionally generate and spread false\ncontent with the aim to deceive or cause harm, such as “deepfake” images, videos, and\naudio—referring to a false depiction of a person, edited or generated by an AI\nalgorithm. The danger of deepfakes is particularly evident when they are used to\ntarget or harm others. While the images or videos themselves may be artificial, the\ndamage they cause is real, leaving “deep scars in the hearts of those who suffer it”\nand “real wounds in their human dignity.”\n\n88. On a broader scale, by distorting “our relationship with others and with\nreality,” AI-generated fake media can gradually undermine the foundations\nof society. This issue requires careful regulation, as misinformation—especially\nthrough AI-controlled or influenced media—can spread unintentionally, fueling\npolitical polarization and social unrest. When society becomes indifferent to the\ntruth, various groups construct their own versions of “facts,” weakening the\n“reciprocal ties and mutual dependencies” that underpin the fabric of\nsocial life. As deepfakes cause people to question everything and AI-generated false\ncontent erodes trust in what they see and hear, polarization and conflict will only\ngrow. Such widespread deception is no trivial matter; it strikes at the core of\nhumanity, dismantling the foundational trust on which societies are\nbuilt.\n\n89. Countering AI-driven falsehoods is not only the work of industry experts—it\nrequires the efforts of all people of goodwill. “If technology is to serve human\ndignity and not harm it, and if it is to promote peace rather than violence, then the\nhuman community must be proactive in addressing these trends with respect to human\ndignity and the promotion of the good.” Those who produce and share\nAI-generated content should always exercise diligence in verifying the truth of what\nthey disseminate and, in all cases, should “avoid the sharing of words and images\nthat are degrading of human beings, that promote hatred and intolerance, that debase\nthe goodness and intimacy of human sexuality or that exploit the weak and\nvulnerable.” This calls for the ongoing prudence and careful discernment\nof all users regarding their activity online.\n\n*AI, Privacy, and Surveillance*\n\n90. Humans are inherently relational, and the data each person generates in the\ndigital world can be seen as an objectified expression of this relational nature.\nData conveys not only information but also personal and relational knowledge, which,\nin an increasingly digitized context, can amount to power over the individual.\nMoreover, while some types of data may pertain to public aspects of a person’s life,\nothers may touch upon the individual’s interiority, perhaps even their conscience.\nSeen in this way, privacy plays an essential role in protecting the boundaries of a\nperson’s inner life, preserving their freedom to relate to others, express\nthemselves, and make decisions without undue control. This protection is also tied to\nthe defense of religious freedom, as surveillance can also be misused to exert\ncontrol over the lives of believers and how they express their faith.\n\n91. It is appropriate, therefore, to address the issue of privacy from a concern for\nthe legitimate freedom and inalienable dignity of the human person “in all\ncircumstances.” The Second Vatican Council included the right “to\nsafeguard privacy” among the fundamental rights “necessary for living a genuinely\nhuman life,” a right that should be extended to all people on account of their\n“sublime dignity.” Furthermore, the Church has also affirmed the right to\nthe legitimate respect for a private life in the context of affirming the person’s\nright to a good reputation, defense of their physical and mental integrity, and\nfreedom from harm or undue intrusion—essential components of the due\nrespect for the intrinsic dignity of the human person.\n\n92. Advances in AI-powered data processing and analysis now make it possible to infer\npatterns in a person’s behavior and thinking from even a small amount of information,\nmaking the role of data privacy even more imperative as a safeguard for the dignity\nand relational nature of the human person. As Pope Francis observed, “while closed\nand intolerant attitudes towards others are on the rise, distances are otherwise\nshrinking or disappearing to the point that the right to privacy scarcely exists.\nEverything has become a kind of spectacle to be examined and inspected, and people’s\nlives are now under constant surveillance.”\n\n93. While there can be legitimate and proper ways to use AI in keeping with human\ndignity and the common good, using it for surveillance aimed at exploiting,\nrestricting others’ freedom, or benefitting a few at the expense of the many is\nunjustifiable. The risk of surveillance overreach must be monitored by appropriate\nregulators to ensure transparency and public accountability. Those responsible for\nsurveillance should never exceed their authority, which must always favor the dignity\nand freedom of every person as the essential basis of a just and humane society.\n\n94. Furthermore, “fundamental respect for human dignity demands that we refuse to\nallow the uniqueness of the person to be identified with a set of data.”\nThis especially applies when AI is used to evaluate individuals or groups based on\ntheir behavior, characteristics, or history—a practice known as “social scoring”: “In\nsocial and economic decision-making, we should be cautious about delegating judgments\nto algorithms that process data, often collected surreptitiously, on an individual’s\nmakeup and prior behavior. Such data can be contaminated by societal prejudices and\npreconceptions. A person’s past behavior should not be used to deny him or her the\nopportunity to change, grow, and contribute to society. We cannot allow algorithms to\nlimit or condition respect for human dignity, or to exclude compassion, mercy,\nforgiveness, and above all, the hope that people are able to change.”\n\n*AI and the Protection of Our Common Home*\n\n95. AI has many promising applications for improving our relationship with our\n“common home,” such as creating models to forecast extreme climate events, proposing\nengineering solutions to reduce their impact, managing relief operations, and\npredicting population shifts. Additionally, AI can support sustainable\nagriculture, optimize energy usage, and provide early warning systems for public\nhealth emergencies. These advancements have the potential to strengthen resilience\nagainst climate-related challenges and promote more sustainable development.\n\n96. At the same time, current AI models and the hardware required to support them\nconsume vast amounts of energy and water, significantly contributing to CO2 emissions\nand straining resources. This reality is often obscured by the way this technology is\npresented in the popular imagination, where words such as “the cloud” \ncan give the impression that data is stored and processed in an intangible realm,\ndetached from the physical world. However, “the cloud” is not an ethereal domain\nseparate from the physical world; as with all computing technologies, it relies on\nphysical machines, cables, and energy. The same is true of the technology behind AI.\nAs these systems grow in complexity, especially large language models (LLMs), they\nrequire ever-larger datasets, increased computational power, and greater storage\ninfrastructure. Considering the heavy toll these technologies take on the\nenvironment, it is vital to develop sustainable solutions that reduce their impact on\nour common home.\n\n97. Even then, as Pope Francis teaches, it is essential “that we look for solutions\nnot only in technology but in a change of humanity.” A complete and\nauthentic understanding of creation recognizes that the value of all created things\ncannot be reduced to their mere utility. Therefore, a fully human approach to the\nstewardship of the earth rejects the distorted anthropocentrism of the technocratic\nparadigm, which seeks to “extract everything possible” from the world, \nand rejects the “myth of progress,” which assumes that “ecological problems will\nsolve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without any need\nfor ethical considerations or deep change.” Such a mindset must give way\nto a more holistic approach that respects the order of creation and promotes the\nintegral good of the human person while safeguarding our common home. \n\n*AI and Warfare*\n\n98. The Second Vatican Council and the consistent teaching of the Popes since then\nhave insisted that peace is not merely the absence of war and is not limited to\nmaintaining a balance of powers between adversaries. Instead, in the words of Saint\nAugustine, peace is “the tranquility of order.”  Indeed, peace cannot be\nattained without safeguarding the goods of persons, free communication, respect for\nthe dignity of persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of fraternity. Peace\nis the work of justice and the effect of charity and cannot be achieved through force\nalone; instead, it must be principally built through patient diplomacy, the active\npromotion of justice, solidarity, integral human development, and respect for the\ndignity of all people. In this way, the tools used to maintain peace\nshould never be allowed to justify injustice, violence, or oppression. Instead, they\nshould always be governed by a “firm determination to respect other people and\nnations, along with their dignity, as well as the deliberate practice of\nfraternity.”\n\n99. While AI’s analytical abilities could help nations seek peace and ensure\nsecurity, the “weaponization of Artificial Intelligence” can also be highly\nproblematic. Pope Francis has observed that “the ability to conduct military\noperations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the\ndevastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their\nuse, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of\nwar.” Moreover, the ease with which autonomous weapons make war more\nviable militates against the principle of war as a last resort in legitimate\nself-defense, potentially increasing the instruments of war well beyond\nthe scope of human oversight and precipitating a destabilizing arms race, with\ncatastrophic consequences for human rights.\n\n100. In particular, Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which are capable of\nidentifying and striking targets without direct human intervention, are a “cause for\ngrave ethical concern” because they lack the “unique human capacity for moral\njudgment and ethical decision-making.” For this reason, Pope Francis has\nurgently called for a reconsideration of the development of these weapons and a\nprohibition on their use, starting with “an effective and concrete commitment to\nintroduce ever greater and proper human control. No machine should ever choose to\ntake the life of a human being.”\n\n101. Since it is a small step from machines that can kill autonomously with precision\nto those capable of large-scale destruction, some AI researchers have expressed\nconcerns that such technology poses an “existential risk” by having the potential to\nact in ways that could threaten the survival of entire regions or even of humanity\nitself. This danger demands serious attention, reflecting the long-standing concern\nabout technologies that grant war “an uncontrollable destructive power over great\nnumbers of innocent civilians,” without even sparing children. In this\ncontext, the call from * Gaudium et Spes* to “undertake an evaluation of war\nwith an entirely new attitude” is more urgent than ever.\n\n102. At the same time, while the theoretical risks of AI deserve attention, the more\nimmediate and pressing concern lies in how individuals with malicious intentions\nmight misuse this technology. Like any tool, AI is an extension of human\npower, and while its future capabilities are unpredictable, humanity’s past actions\nprovide clear warnings. The atrocities committed throughout history are enough to\nraise deep concerns about the potential abuses of AI.\n\n103. Saint John Paul II observed that “humanity now has instruments of unprecedented\npower: we can turn this world into a garden, or reduce it to a pile of\nrubble.” Given this fact, the Church reminds us, in the words of Pope\nFrancis, that “we are free to apply our intelligence towards things evolving\npositively,” or toward “decadence and mutual destruction.” To prevent\nhumanity from spiraling into self-destruction, there must be a clear\nstand against all applications of technology that inherently threaten human life and\ndignity. This commitment requires careful discernment about the use of AI,\nparticularly in military defense applications, to ensure that it always respects\nhuman dignity and serves the common good. The development and deployment of AI in\narmaments should be subject to the highest levels of ethical scrutiny, governed by a\nconcern for human dignity and the sanctity of life.\n\n*AI and Our Relationship with God*\n\n104. Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world’s resources.\nHowever, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to\nmachines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about\nthe potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI\nthat would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable\nadvancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At\nthe same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some\nare tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment—longings that can only\nbe truly satisfied in communion with God.\n\n105. However, *the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is\nidolatry*, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5;\n34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike\nidols that “have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not\nhear” (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can “speak,” or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf.\nRev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of\nhumanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material,\nresponsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many\nof the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI\nas a perceived “Other” greater than itself, with which to share existence and\nresponsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI\nthat is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself—which, in this way,\nbecomes enslaved to its own work.\n\n106. While AI has the potential to serve humanity and contribute to the common good,\nit remains a creation of human hands, bearing “the imprint of human art and\ningenuity” (Acts 17:29). It must never be ascribed undue worth. As the Book of Wisdom\naffirms: “For a man made them, and one whose spirit is borrowed formed them; for no\nman can form a god which is like himself. He is mortal, and what he makes with\nlawless hands is dead, for he is better than the objects he worships since he has\nlife, but they never have” (Wis. 15:16-17).\n\n107. In contrast, human beings, “by their interior life, transcend the entire\nmaterial universe; they experience this deep interiority when they enter into their\nown heart, where God, who probes the heart, awaits them, and where they decide their\nown destiny in the sight of God.” It is within the heart, as Pope Francis\nreminds us, that each individual discovers the “mysterious connection between\nself-knowledge and openness to others, between the encounter with one’s personal\nuniqueness and the willingness to give oneself to others.” Therefore, it\nis the heart alone that is “capable of setting our other powers and passions, and our\nentire person, in a stance of reverence and loving obedience before the\nLord,” who “offers to treat each one of us as a ‘Thou,’ always and\nforever.”\n\nVI. Concluding Reflections\n\n108. Considering the various challenges posed by advances in technology, Pope Francis\nemphasized the need for growth in “human responsibility, values, and conscience,”\nproportionate to the growth in the potential that this technology\nbrings—recognizing that “with an increase in human power comes a\nbroadening of responsibility on the part of individuals and communities.”\n\n109. At the same time, the “essential and fundamental question” remains “whether in\nthe context of this progress man, as man, is becoming truly better, that is to say,\nmore mature spiritually, more aware of the dignity of his humanity, more responsible,\nmore open to others, especially the neediest and the weakest, and readier to give and\nto aid all.”\n\n110. As a result, it is crucial to know how to evaluate individual applications of AI\nin particular contexts to determine whether its use promotes human dignity, the\nvocation of the human person, and the common good. As with many technologies, the\neffects of the various uses of AI may not always be predictable from their inception.\nAs these applications and their social impacts become clearer, appropriate responses\nshould be made at all levels of society, following the principle of subsidiarity.\nIndividual users, families, civil society, corporations, institutions, governments,\nand international organizations should work at their proper levels to ensure that AI\nis used for the good of all.\n\n111. A significant challenge and opportunity for the common good today lies in\nconsidering AI within a framework of relational intelligence, which emphasizes the\ninterconnectedness of individuals and communities and highlights our shared\nresponsibility for fostering the integral well-being of others. The twentieth-century\nphilosopher Nicholas Berdyaev observed that people often blame machines for personal\nand social problems; however, “this only humiliates man and does not correspond to\nhis dignity,” for “it is unworthy to transfer responsibility from man to a\nmachine.” Only the human person can be morally responsible, and the\nchallenges of a technological society are ultimately *spiritual* in nature.\nTherefore, facing those challenges “demands an intensification of\nspirituality.”\n\n112. A further point to consider is the call, prompted by the appearance of AI on the\nworld stage, for a *renewed appreciation of all that is human*. Years ago, the French\nCatholic author Georges Bernanos warned that “the danger is not in the multiplication\nof machines, but in the ever-increasing number of men accustomed from their childhood\nto desire only what machines can give.” This challenge is as true today\nas it was then, as the rapid pace of digitization risks a “digital reductionism,”\nwhere non-quantifiable aspects of life are set aside and then forgotten or even\ndeemed irrelevant because they cannot be computed in formal terms. AI should be used\nonly as a tool to complement human intelligence rather than replace its\nrichness. Cultivating those aspects of human life that transcend\ncomputation is crucial for preserving “an authentic humanity” that “seems to dwell in\nthe midst of our technological culture, almost unnoticed, like a mist seeping gently\nbeneath a closed door.”\n\n*True Wisdom*\n\n113. The vast expanse of the world’s knowledge is now accessible in ways that would\nhave filled past generations with awe. However, to ensure that advancements in\nknowledge do not become humanly or spiritually barren, one must go beyond the mere\naccumulation of data and strive to achieve true wisdom.\n\n114. This wisdom is the gift that humanity needs most to address the profound\nquestions and ethical challenges posed by AI: “Only by adopting a spiritual way of\nviewing reality, only by recovering a wisdom of the heart, can we confront and\ninterpret the newness of our time.” Such “wisdom of the heart” is “the\nvirtue that enables us to integrate the whole and its parts, our decisions and their\nconsequences.” It “cannot be sought from machines,” but it “lets itself be found by\nthose who seek it and be seen by those who love it; it anticipates those who desire\nit, and it goes in search of those who are worthy of it (cf. Wis\n6:12-16).”\n\n115. In a world marked by AI, we need the grace of the Holy Spirit, who “enables us\nto look at things with God’s eyes, to see connections, situations, events and to\nuncover their real meaning.”\n\n116. Since a “person’s perfection is measured not by the information or knowledge\nthey possess, but by the depth of their charity,” how we incorporate AI\n“to include the least of our brothers and sisters, the vulnerable, and those most in\nneed, will be the true measure of our humanity.” The “wisdom of the\nheart” can illuminate and guide the human-centered use of this technology to help\npromote the common good, care for our “common home,” advance the search for the\ntruth, foster integral human development, favor human solidarity and fraternity, and\nlead humanity to its ultimate goal: happiness and full communion with\nGod.\n\n117. From this perspective of wisdom, believers will be able to act as moral agents\ncapable of using this technology to promote an authentic vision of the human person\nand society. This should be done with the understanding that\ntechnological progress is part of God’s plan for creation—an activity that we are\ncalled to order toward the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ, in the continual search\nfor the True and the Good.\n\n*The Supreme Pontiff, Francis, at the Audience granted on 14 January 2025 to the\nundersigned Prefects and Secretaries of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith\nand the Dicastery for Culture and Education, approved this *Note* and ordered its\npublication.*\n\nGiven in Rome, at the offices of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and the\nDicastery for Culture and Education, on 28 January 2025, the Liturgical Memorial of\nSaint Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Church.\n\n\nVíctor Manuel Card.

Yet, this negative view\nof the body is inconsistent with a proper understanding of human dignity. While the\nChurch supports genuine scientific progress, it affirms that human dignity is rooted\nin “the person as an inseparable unity of body and soul.” Thus, “dignity is also\ninherent in each person’s body, which participates in its own way in being *in*\n*imago Dei*” (Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, Declaration * Dignitas\nInfinita *8 April 2024, par. 18).\n\n This approach reflects a functionalist perspective, which reduces the\nhuman mind to its functions and assumes that its functions can be entirely quantified\nin physical or mathematical terms. However, even if a future AGI were to appear truly\nintelligent, it would still remain functional in nature.\n\n Cf. A.M. Turing, “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” *Mind *59 (1950)\n443-460.\n\n If “thinking” is attributed to machines, it must be clarified that this\nrefers to calculative thinking rather than critical thinking. Similarly, if machines\nare said to operate using logical thinking, it must be specified that this is limited\nto computational logic. On the other hand, by its very nature, human thought is a\ncreative process that eludes programming and transcends constraints.\n\n On the foundational role of language in shaping understanding, cf. M.\nHeidegger, *Über den Humanismus*, Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main 1949 (en. tr.\n“Letter on Humanism,” in *Basic Writings: Martin Heidegger*, Routledge, London ‒ New\nYork 2010, 141-182).\n\n For further discussion of these anthropological and theological\nfoundations, see AI Research Group of the Centre for Digital Culture of the Dicastery\nfor Culture and Education, *Encountering Artificial Intelligence: Ethical and\nAnthropological Investigations* (Theological Investigations of Artificial\nIntelligence 1), M.J.

Now, this faculty is reason itself, or the ‘mind,’ or\n‘intelligence,’ whatever other name it may more suitably be given”; Id.,\n*Enarrationes in Psalmos *54, 3: PL 36, 629: “When considering all that they have,\nhumans discover that they are most distinguished from animals precisely by the fact\nthey possess intelligence.” This is also reiterated by Saint Thomas Aquinas, who\nstates that “man is the most perfect of all earthly beings endowed with motion, and\nhis proper and natural operation is intellection,” by which man abstracts from things\nand “receives in his mind things actually intelligible” (Thomas Aquinas, *Summa\nContra Gentiles *II, 76).\n\n Cf.

Writing, for\nexample, is often associated with the structuring of thinking. With GenAI …, humans\ncan now start with a well-structured outline provided by GenAI. Some experts have\ncharacterized the use of GenAI to generate text in this way as ‘writing without\nthinking’” (UNESCO, *Guidance for Generative AI in Education and Research *,\n37-38). The German-American philosopher Hannah Arendt foresaw such a possibility in\nher 1959 book, *The Human Condition*, and cautioned: “If it should turn out to be\ntrue that knowledge (in the sense of know-how) and thought have parted company for\ngood, then we would indeed become the helpless slaves, not so much of our machines as\nof our know-how” (Id., * The Human Condition*, University of Chicago Press, Chicago\n2018², 3).\n\n Francis, Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation *  Amoris Laetitia*\n(19 March 2016), par. 262: *AAS *108 (2016), 417.\n\n Francis, * Message for the LVII World Day of Peace* (1 January\n2024), par. 7: *L’Osservatore Romano*, 14 December 2023, 3; cf.

Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B instruct, while being\nmore than 3x faster on the same hardware.\n\nMistral Small 3 is a pre-trained and instructed model catered to the ‘80%’ of\ngenerative AI tasks—those that require robust language and instruction following\nperformance, with very low latency.\n\nWe designed this new model to saturate performance at a size suitable for local\ndeployment. Particularly, Mistral Small 3 has far fewer layers than competing\nmodels, substantially reducing the time per forward pass. At over 81% accuracy\non MMLU and 150 tokens/s latency, Mistral Small is currently the most efficient\nmodel of its category.\n\nWe’re releasing both a pretrained and instruction-tuned checkpoint under Apache\n2.0. The checkpoints can serve as a powerful base for accelerating progress.\nNote that Mistral Small 3 is neither trained with RL nor synthetic data, so is\nearlier in the model production pipeline than models like Deepseek R1 (a great\nand complementary piece of open-source technology!). It can serve as a great\nbase model for building accrued reasoning capacities. We look forward to seeing\nhow the open-source community adopts and customizes it.\n\n### Performance\n\n#### Human Evaluations\n\nDetailed benchmarks\n\nWe conducted side by side evaluations with an external third-party vendor, on a\nset of over 1k proprietary coding and generalist prompts. Evaluators were tasked\nwith selecting their preferred model response from anonymized generations\nproduced by Mistral Small 3 vs another model. We are aware that in some cases\nthe benchmarks on human judgement starkly differ from publicly available\nbenchmarks, but have taken extra caution in verifying a fair evaluation. We are\nconfident that the above benchmarks are valid.\n\n#### Instruct performance\n\nOur instruction tuned model performs competitively with open weight models three\ntimes its size and with proprietary GPT4o-mini model across Code, Math, General\nknowledge and Instruction following benchmarks.\n\nDetailed benchmarks\nDetailed benchmarks\nDetailed benchmarks\n\nPerformance accuracy on all benchmarks were obtained through the same internal\nevaluation pipeline - as such, numbers may vary slightly from previously\nreported performance (Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct,\nGemma-2-27B-IT). Judge based evals such as Wildbench, Arena hard and\nMTBench were based on gpt-4o-2024-05-13.\n\n#### Pretraining performance\n\nDetailed benchmarks\nDetailed benchmarks\n\nMistral Small 3, a 24B model, offers the best performance for its size class and\nrivals with models three times larger such as Llama 3.3 70B.\n\n### When to use Mistral Small 3\n\nAcross our customers and community, we are seeing several distinct use cases\nemerge for pre-trained models of this size:\n\n* Fast-response conversational assistance: Mistral Small 3 excels in scenarios\n  where quick, accurate responses are critical. This includes virtual assistants\n  in many scenarios where users expect immediate feedback and near real-time\n  interactions.\n* Low-latency function calling: Mistral Small 3 is able to handle rapid function\n  execution when used as part of automated or agentic workflows.\n* Fine-tuning to create subject matter experts: Mistral Small 3 can be\n  fine-tuned to specialize in specific domains, creating highly accurate subject\n  matter experts. This is particularly useful in fields like legal advice,\n  medical diagnostics, and technical support, where domain-specific knowledge is\n  essential.\n* Local inference: Particularly beneficial for hobbyists and organizations\n  handling sensitive or proprietary information. When quantized, Mistral Small 3\n  can be run privately on a single RTX 4090 or a Macbook with 32GB RAM.\n\nOur customers are evaluating Mistral Small 3 across multiple industries,\nincluding:\n\n* Financial services customers for fraud detection\n* Healthcare providers for customer triaging\n* Robotics, automotive, and manufacturing companies for on-device command and\n  control\n* Horizontal use cases across customers include virtual customer service, and\n  sentiment and feedback analysis.\n\n### Using Mistral Small 3 on your preferred tech stack\n\nMistral Small 3 is now available on la Plateforme as `mistral-small-latest` or\n`mistral-small-2501`. Explore our docs to learn how to use our models for\ntext generation.\n\nWe are also excited to collaborate with Hugging Face, Ollama, Kaggle, Together\nAI, and Fireworks AI to make the model available on their platforms starting\ntoday:\n\n* Hugging Face (base model)\n* Ollama\n* Kaggle\n* Together AI\n* Fireworks AI\n* Coming soon on NVIDIA NIM, Amazon SageMaker, Groq, Databricks and Snowflake\n\n### The road ahead\n\nIt’s been exciting days for the open-source community! Mistral Small 3\ncomplements large open-source reasoning models like the recent releases of\nDeepSeek, and can serve as a strong base model for making reasoning capabilities\nemerge.\n\nAmong many other things, expect small and large Mistral models with boosted\nreasoning capabilities in the coming weeks. Join the journey if you’re keen\n(we’re hiring), or beat us to it by hacking Mistral Small 3 today and making it\nbetter!\n\n### Open-source models at Mistral\n\n**We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for our general\npurpose models, as we progressively move away from MRL-licensed models**.

The opinions on\nthis site are my own.\n\n### Scalable OLTP in the Cloud: What’s the BIG DEAL?\n\n* Get link\n* Facebook\n* X\n* Pinterest\n* Email\n* Other Apps\n-  January 17, 2024 \n\nThis paper is from Pat Helland, the apostate philosopher of database\nsystems, overall a superb person, and a good friend of mine. The paper appeared\nthis week at CIDR'24. (Check out the program for other interesting papers).\nThe motivating question behind this work is: \"What are the asymptotic limits to\nscale for cloud OLTP (OnLine Transaction Processing) systems?\" Pat says that the\nCIDR 2023 paper \"Is Scalable OLTP in the Cloud a Solved Problem?\" prompted\nthis question.\n\nThe answer to the question? Pat says that the answer lies in the joint\nresponsibility of database and the application. If you know of Pat's work, which\nI have summarized several in this blog, you would know that Pat has been\nadvocating along these lines before. But this paper provides a very crisp,\nspecific, concrete answer. Read on for my summary of the paper.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a wisdom and technical information/detail packed 13-page\npaper, so I will try my best to summarize the salient points. I will be using\ntext from the paper to explain/summarize it. (Don't taze me bro!)\n\n\n\n# Snapshot Isolation (SI) is a BIG DEAL\n\nThe database and the application have a BIG DEAL: their isolation semantics! In\nparticular, snapshot isolation (SI) is the sweet spot. At this point, I got a\nnice database history lesson on how the isolation semantics evolved. I would\nhave guessed the semantics had become more strict over time. No, on the\ncontrary, they evolved to be more relaxed to meet performance and scalability\nexpectations. And SI does hit a sweet point in that it still provides the user\ngood isolation guarantees without jeopardizing the scaling behavior of the\ndatabase by requiring it to serialize everything.\n\nIn the rest of the paper, keep in mind that, an OLTP system is defined as a\ndomain-specific application using a RCSI (READ COMMITTED SNAPSHOT ISOLATION) SQL\ndatabase to provide transactions across many concurrent users.\n\nThe BIG DEAL splits the scaling responsibilities between the database and the\napplication.\n\n* Scalable DBs don’t coordinate across disjoint TXs updating different keys.\n* Scalable apps don’t concurrently update the same key.\n\nThe big deal provides guarantees from the DB to the App. A scalable application\ncan read all it wants. Updates to disjoint records don’t coordinate across TXs.\nRow-locks on disjoint records don’t coordinate across TXs.\n\nApplications must tolerate these big deal disclaimers. Reads return snapshots:\nRecords have no \"current\" value. There is no NOW in a BIG DEAL database!\nTransactions may abort any time but not too often. SELECT with SKIP LOCKED may\nsubset the set of qualifying records as it returns results.\n\nThis means applications should change business behavior in order to scale. They\ncan only provide a fuzzy/blurry view of the \"current\" state/changes. So, apps\nintroduce ambiguity in biz domain specific ways: online retail makes ambiguous\npromises such as \"Usually ships in 24 hours\". And apps provide delayed truth:\nfinances of a large company may take days to summarize. Many OLTP apps aggregate\nvalues synchronously as they interact with humans. Public TPC benchmarks (e.g.,\nTPC-A, TPC-B, and TPC-C) mandated synchronous aggregations. But, as applications\nscale they should rethink concentrating the aggregated values of business state\nin dedicated records. By slowly and asynchronously aggregating these business\nstate, the application can scale in a domain-specific manner.\n\n\n\n# Today's OLTP databases don't scale\n\nBefore suggesting a hypothetical scalable database that satisfies the database\nside of the big deal, Pat shows us why today’s databases don’t scale!\n\nIn today's MVCC databases, reads & writes fight to access the \"current\" value of\na record. The current version has a home location (a partition, server, or a B+\ntree) holding the most recently committed version of the record or perhaps an\nuncommitted version. To update a record, exclusive access to the record's home\nis required. This causes infighting, contention, and coordination between the\nupdating TX and any concurrent reading TXs.\n\nEven reads contend with each other, since these implementations force MVCC\nreaders to start out looking at the latest version of a key first. Coordination\nmay also be needed to access neighboring records. Accessing key-ranges in\nB+Trees or similar data structures that may be changing needs cross-transaction\ncoordination.\n\nReaders coordinate with writers. Writers coordinate with readers. Readers\ncoordinate with other readers!\n\nHaving a home for a record also makes online repartitioning/sharding (which is\nrequired for scalability) very difficult. Moving record keys from one partition\nto another is complex and impacts application availability.\n\nTo address these challenges, Pat proposes a prototype design. The database is\nstructured so that there is no pre-assigned home for a record per key. Unlike\npartitioned DBs, this allows the database to seamlessly adapt to workload\nchanges.\n\nI liken this to the miscellaneous manifesto or how instead of neatly\norganizing/allocating everything a place (which inevitably fails, requiring\nincessant re-orgs), embracing the messiness and using a search engine to get to\ninformation quickly.\n\n\n\n# Rethinking OLTP databases\n\nThe architecture is based on a design Pat explored in a previous work. The\nwork is very technical, and I missed the nuance and contributions of it because\nI didn't read through the appendix about details.\n\nOwner servers verify that concurrent transactions have not created any\nconflicting updates for each key row-locked or updated by the TX that\noptimistically hopes to commit. Owner servers partitioned by both key-range and\ntime-range. Repartitioning happens dynamically to accommodate scale.\n\nWorker servers are also horizontally scalable, and each have their own\ntransaction log. As TX load increases, workers are added. Each TX happens at a\nsingle worker server. The worker servers accept connections from app servers,\nperform transactions & their queries, commit transactions to their per-worker\nlog, and periodically flush committed new record-versions to the LSM (log\nstructured merge tree).\n\nLSM servers accept flushes from workers and incorporate them into the orderly\npast stored in the LSM. Record-versions are organized first by time, second by\nkey. Each LSM layer contains record-versions for a band of time. With an LSM,\nthe past scales without coordinating across disjoint transactions reading and\nupdating!\n\n\n\n# Transaction execution and commit\n\nWe now deep dive to workers and owners as they are the most significant\ncomponents in this OLTP architecture. The owners do the concurrency control (the\nadjudication of transactions with respect to other concurrent transactions), but\nthe workers do the actual work of the transaction. The transaction is\ncentralized in the worker's log. The workers' logs are ingested by LSM servers\nfor later consumption and durability.\n\nThe worker will accept incoming connections from application servers, and\nplan/execute SQL statements: Reading with snapshots by key or key-range,\nacquiring row-locks using their unique record key, and updating records by their\nunique key. The worker will guess a future time to hopefully commit after being\nverified that updates and row-locks don’t conflict with concurrent TXs. The\nworker will then log the transaction’s updates & commit record in its local\ntransaction log, which will then be fed into LSM servers.\n\nAs a commit-time for a transaction is guessed by the worker, every update and\nrow-lock must be verified for no conflicting updates from snapshot to commit by\nthe owner servers. As incoming proposed-updates and verify-locks arrive, they\ninclude a proposed-commit-time. Owner-servers align commit-time for records &\nworkers. An incoming request from a worker hopefully arrives at the owner-server\nbefore its local clock has reached the proposed-commit-time. If it arrives after\ncommit-time, owner-server returns an error and the TX aborts. If it arrives\nbefore commit-time, the owner-server waits until its local clock reaches\ncommit-time.\n\nWhat are row-locks you ask?\n\nRow-locks allow the application to ask the database for help with concurrency\nacross transactions. Traffic cops provide pessimistic concurrency control. They\nwill stall later transactions if they acquire a row-lock held by an earlier\ntransaction. This pessimistic ordering of transactions may be violated when\nfailures happen. Competing transactions usually wait to allow the lock holder to\ngo first but that may be flawed. So correctness will be enforced by OCC prior to\ncommit. Of course, row-locks are moot when scalable apps avoid concurrent\nupdates to the same records. But if the app experience concurrent updates to the\nsame records, row-locks can help with the liveness of transactions when the DB\nuses them to function as a traffic cop.\n\nOk, let's wrap up the transaction execution discussion by talking about how\nowners can be horizontally scaled. Owners can close for new business and direct\nnew proposed-updates elsewhere. An owner closed for new business only accept\nworker requests for snapshot reads in their rectangle of key & time ranges,\nproposed updates, and notifications of transaction outcome. In contrast an owner\nopen for new business also allow new proposed-updates, and new verify-locks.\n\n\n\n# Massive Scale: It’s About Time!\n\nAs we have seen, the DB leverages time to provide snapshots, commits, and\nexternal consistency. External Consistency ensures new incoming requests see all\npreviously exposed data, even by other database connections. That means,\nsnapshot reads from new incoming work must be after all committed work\npreviously visible outside the database.\n\nBy using current time, T-now, as the snapshot time, this is easy. But this would\nget trickier and more complex as the geographic scope of a DB grows past a\nsingle datacenter.\n\nOverall, this prototype database architecture is a big vindication for using\ntime in systems. (Some of these ideas have been explored in Pat's earlier paper,\nunder seniority and retirement.) Everything in the database is versioned by the\nrecord-version commit time. The database organizes data by its creation time to\nachieve scaling. Reads are old record-versions as of a past snapshot. Row-locks\nensure locked records unchanged until commit time. And updates materialize as\nnew record-versions for later snapshots.\n\n \ndatabases distributed transactions distSQL newsql\nOLTP paper-review SQL\n\n* Get link\n* Facebook\n* X\n* Pinterest\n* Email\n* Other Apps\n\n### Comments\n\nFranck Pachot said…\nThis article is based on the claim that MVCC reads have to compete with\nconcurrent writes, but that is incorrect. In fact, it's the opposite. Non-MVCC\ndatabases had to acquire a lock to read because they only have access to the\ncurrent version.\n\nIn contrast, MVCC databases can read from a past state. The past doesn't change\nbecause nobody can modify the past version of anything (except for Terminator).\nThat's why in MVCC you can read the past versions without acquiring any lock on\nthem. MVCC databases can even read from the read-only standby replica to scale\nout the reads, ignoring concurrent reads on the primary.\n January 18, 2024 at 1:20 PM \nMurat said…\nYes, MVCC helps. But, as Pat shows in the paper, and outlines in Table 1, in the\nexisting MVCC implementations, since the current record is in the path of\nreaching the snapshot reads, there is infighting and contention.\n January 18, 2024 at 2:11 PM \nFranck Pachot said…\nThe problem is that the author doesn't show it but claims, maybe from SQL Server\nimplementation (which I don't know in detail but all terms used are SQL Server\nones to it, and he ignores that Oracle and PostgreSQL store rows in Heap Tables,\nnot in the primary key).\n\nHe claims that the current row must have the location of the previous one. It is\nthe opposite in PostgreSQL:\nhttps://postgrespro.com/blog/pgsql/5967892#:~:text=ctid. When the current\nversion is updated, it adds a pointer in the previous one. This is additional\nwork for the writers, but readers do not have to go to the current version\nexcept if their read time is higher than the past version.\n\nIn Oracle, the current row points to the transaction log to build a previous\nimage but only needs a short shared latch. Then, the buffer clone can be used by\nmany other consistent reads. The buffer cache holds 5 versions by default, which\ncovers most of the queries read times without rereading the current buffer. I've\nseen contention on rollback segments but never on the current buffer (XCUR in\nV$BH). Good explanation here:\nhttp://oracleinaction.com/consistent-reads-in-oracle-part-i/\n January 19, 2024 at 3:17 AM \nbad.engineer said…\nI believe I understand what you are saying, and I entirely agree the subtly of\nimplementation matters here since the author's point is itself subtle. My\ncharitable interpretation would be the following.\n\nIf we consider a record to include both an index entry & heap tuple, it is\ncorrect to state new index entries are replaced in Oracle & placed next to older\nversions in Postgres. These would be the mechanisms of contention in Table 1.\n\nNot all varieties of reads will contend via this mechanism.\n\nThat being said, I can understand why this point was omitted from the paper\nsince any read that doesn't use an index will result in a larger scope of access\nand more necessary coordination.\n January 19, 2024 at 12:55 PM \nsb said…\nGetting cooperation from the OLTP app side is interestingly nothing mentioned\n(atleast in your summary), now that becomes relevant when you think of the key,\nis it stock itself or the trade/order IDs? A basket of NiFTY 500 order\nprocessing will swarm the workers to grow rapidly, while owners adjusting its\nkey ranges to the workers? I suppose splitting the whole transaction work into\nmultiple dedicated servers is ignoring the network chatter required (imagine\njust clock sync overhead for a nanosecond future commit timestamp in your\nsummary) to scale. MVCC and realtime read/write with trade guarantees is hard,\nreally hard, I mean will you place another million dollar without knowing the\nprevious one really went through or not? No overlapping key updates (single\ntrades) days are ancient, TPCC is just primary exam in terms of today's basket\ntrading and search for sub-nanosecond latency.\nHaving developed such apps/ similar databases and now reinventing myself for low\nlatency programming, I've few ideas that be worth something that sees through\nboth sides of the aforementioned \"coordination required to scale\".\n January 22, 2024 at 7:45 AM \n Post a Comment \n\n### Popular posts from this blog\n\n### Hints for Distributed Systems Design\n\n-  October 02, 2023 \nThis is with apologies to Butler Lampson, who published the \" Hints for computer\nsystem design \" paper 40 years ago in SOSP'83. I don't claim to match that work\nof course. I just thought I could draft this post to organize my thinking about\ndesigning distributed systems and get feedback from others. I start with the\nsame disclaimer Lampson gave. These hints are not novel, not foolproof recipes,\nnot laws of design, not precisely formulated, and not always appropriate. They\nare just hints. They are context dependent, and some of them may be\ncontroversial. That being said, I have seen these hints successfully applied in\ndistributed systems design throughout my 25 years in the field, starting from\nthe theory of distributed systems (98-01), immersing into the practice of\nwireless sensor networks (01-11), and working on cloud computing systems both in\nthe academia and industry ever since.

I\nrecommend a principled, from the foundations-up, studying of distributed\nsystems, which will take a good three months in the first pass, and many more\nmonths to build competence after that. If you are practical and coding oriented\nyou may not like my advice much. You may object saying, \"Shouldn't I learn\ndistributed systems with coding and hands on? Why can I not get started by\ndeploying a Hadoop cluster, or studying the Raft code.\" I think that is the\nwrong way to go about learning distributed systems, because seeing similar code\nand programming language constructs will make you think this is familiar\nterritory, and will give you a false sense of security.

Date's Sigmod 1983 keynote, \"Database Usability\", was prescient. Usability\nis the most important thing to the customers. They care less about impressive\nbenchmarks or clever algorithms, and more about whether they can operate and use\na database efficiently to query, update, analyze, and persist their data with\nminimal headache. (BTW, does anyone have a link to the contents of this\nSigmod'83 talk? There is no transcript around, except for this short abstract .)\nThe paper we cover today is from Sigmod 2007. It takes on the database usability\nproblem raised in that 1983 keynote head-on, and calls out that the king is\nstill naked. Let's give some context for the year 2007. Yes, XML format was\nstill popular then. The use-case in the paper is XQuery. The paper does not\ncontain any reference to json.

This was a pretty straightforward application of LLMs. The proposed\nsystem employs an LLM to match incoming incidents to incident handlers based on\ntheir alert types, predicts the incident's root cause category, and provides an\nexplanatory narrative. The only customization is through prompt-engineering.\nSince this is a custom domain, I think a more principled and custom-designed\nmachine learning system would be more appropriate rather than adopting LLMs.\nAnyways, the use of LLMs for RCAs spooked me vicerally. I couldn't find the\nexact words during the paper discussion, but I can articulate this better now.\nLet me explain.

If you haven't read about the\narchitecture and operation of DynamoDB, please first read my summary of the\nDynamoDB ATC 2022 paper . The big omission in that paper was discussion about\ntransactions. This paper amends that. It is great to see DynamoDB, and AWS in\ngeneral, is publishing/sharing more widely than before. Overview A killer\nfeature of DynamoDB is predictability at any scale. Do read Marc Brooker's post\nto fully appreciate this feature. Aligned with this predictability tenet, when\nadding transactions to DynamoDB, the first and primary constraint was to\npreserve the predictable high performance of single-key reads/writes at any\nscale. The second big constraint was to implement transactions using update\nin-place operation without multi-version concurrency control. The reason for\nthis was they didn't want to mock with the storage layer which did not support\nmulti-versioning.

I had not read this paper in detail before, so I\nthought it would be good to go to the source to see if there are additional\ndelightful surprises in the original text. Hence, this post. I will dive into a\ntechnical analysis of the paper first, and then discuss some of my takes toward\nthe end. I had written an accessible explanation of linearizability earlier; you\nmay want to read that first. I will assume an understanding of linearizability\nto keep this review at reasonable length.

This\napproach decouples compute from storage, allowing for independent and elastic\nscaling of compute and storage resources. It provides fault-tolerance at the\nstorage level. You can then share the storage for other services, such as adding\nread-only replicas for the databases. You can even use the storage level for\neasier sharding of your database. Finally, you can also use this for exporting a\nchangelog asynchronously to feed into peripheral cloud services, such as\nanalytics. Disaggregated architecture was the topic of Sigmod 23 panel . I think\nthis quote summarizes the industry's thinking on the topic. \"Disaggregated\narchitecture is here, and is not going anywhere.

The unicorn had shiny fur and a pretty\ndress. Lily asked the unicorn, \"Where did you come from?\"\nThe unicorn replied, \"I came from the forest and wanted to meet you, Lily. I am\nhere to make sure you are safe.\"\nLily and the unicorn played together and had lots of fun. But then, the unicorn\nstarted to act funny. Lily didn't know what was happening. Suddenly, the unicorn\n turned into a little girl and said, \"I was under a spell, and your kindness \nbroke it. Thank you for breaking it.\"\nLily was surprised and happy. She gave the unicorn a big hug and they played \ntogether all day. From that day on, the unicorn would always come to play with \nLily - her new friend.\n`\n\n`Prompt: The dragon flew over the mountains\n\nOutput:\nThe dragon flew over the mountains, over the rivers and over the rivers. He was\nvery brave and strong.\nOne day, the dragon saw something very strange. It was a big, shiny rock. He \nwanted to know what it was, so he flew down and touched it with his nose. \nSuddenly, the rock began to move!\nThe dragon was so surprised! He had never seen anything like it before. He \nlooked around and saw that it was a little mouse! The mouse was very scared and\nstarted to run away.\nThe dragon was very sad. He wanted to help the mouse, so he decided to try and \nmake friends. He flew around and around until he found the mouse. He said hello\nto the mouse and asked if he wanted to be friends.\nThe mouse was so happy! He said yes, and they played together all day long. From\n then on, the dragon and the mouse were the best of friends. They had lots of \nfun together and the dragon was never lonely again.\n`\n\n## Configuration ⚙️\n\nKey parameters (modify in `config.py`):\n\n**Model Architecture**:\n\nGPTConfig(\n    block_size=512,    # Context length\n    n_layer=8,         # Number of transformer layers\n    n_head=8,          # Number of attention heads\n    n_embed=512,       # Embedding dimension\n    dropout=0.2,       # Dropout rate\n    bias=False         # Use bias in layers\n)\n\n**Training**:\n\nTrainingConfig(\n    batch_size=64,\n    max_iters=30000,\n    learning_rate=6e-4,\n    weight_decay=0.1,\n    grad_clip=1.0,\n    warmup_iters=1000\n)\n\n## File Structure 📁\n\n`om-alve-smolgpt/\n├── config.py       - Model & training configuration\n├── dataset.py      - Data loading & preprocessing\n├── model.py        - GPT model implementation\n├── preprocess.py   - Dataset preparation scripts\n├── sample.py       - Text generation script\n├── tokenizer.py    - Tokenizer wrapper\n└── train.py        - Main training loop\n`\n\n## Contributing 🤝\n\nContributions welcome!
