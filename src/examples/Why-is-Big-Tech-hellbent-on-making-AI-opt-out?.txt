# Why is Big Tech hellbent on making AI opt-out?

 **21** comment bubble on white 

## As Microsoft, Apple, and Google switch the tech on by default, what happened
## to asking for permission first?

Opinion Copilot in Microsoft 365 and Apple Intelligence on iDevices are the
latest examples of the tech industry's obsession with making services opt-out
rather than opt-in.

Last week, Copilot made an unsolicited appearance in Microsoft 365. This
week, Apple turned on Apple Intelligence by default in its upcoming
operating system releases. And it isn't easy to get through any of Google's
services without stumbling over Gemini.

Regulators worldwide are keen to ensure that marketing and similar services are
opt-in. When dark patterns are used to steer users in one direction or
another, lawmakers pay close attention.

But, for some reason, forcing AI on customers is acceptable. Rather than asking
"we're going to shovel a load of AI services into your apps that you never asked
for, but our investors really need you to use, is this OK?" the assumption
instead is that users will be delighted to see their formerly pristine
applications cluttered with AI features.

Customers, however, seem largely dissatisfied. For every study showing how users
are delighted when presented with generative AI tools, others paint a picture of
users regarding the technology with suspicion and some enterprises giving
the services a wide berth.

While we'd hesitate to use the word "enshittification" to describe what
this relentless drive to ram AI down customers' throats is doing to formerly
reliable services (take a look at the sometimes hilariously inaccurate
summaries that now appear at the top of Google search results), it is clear
that things are not going entirely to plan.

e/aiml&amp;sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601

Customers have not asked for any of this. There has been no clamoring for search
summaries, no pent-up demand for the revival of a jumped-up Clippy. There
is no desire to wreak further havoc on the environment to get an almost-correct
recipe for tomato soup. And yet here we are, ready or not.

This might not be what investors and shareholders want to hear, yet there needs
to be a moratorium on adding AI services without *first* asking customers for
consent. Despite promises of local processing and privacy-first technology, it
is difficult to shake off the suspicion the data is being gathered for all
manner of purposes. There would be (and has been – we're looking at you,
Windows Recall) an outcry if spyware and keyloggers were suddenly forced
on users, but generative AI assistants and summarizers appear to have got a free
pass.

* LinkedIn accused of training AI on private messages
* Apple Intelligence turned on by default in upcoming macOS Sequoia 15.3, iOS
  18.3
* Copilot invades Microsoft 365 Personal and Family for an extra three bucks a
  month
* UK businesses eye AI as the cheaper, non-whining alternative to actual
  staff

Microsoft has bet an awful lot on generative AI tech, and by making Copilot
opt-out rather than opt-in, the company can show figures to shareholders that AI
is going swimmingly and it hasn't made a terrible, terrible mistake. The same
applies to Apple, Google, and many others in the tech industry.

This is not to deny the tangible benefits of AI. The technology works well as a
classifier. For example, spotting potholes. As the next generation of
autocomplete for coders, it can be useful. It's also handy when searching,
although, let's face it, Windows Search has never been the jewel in the crown of
Microsoft's flagship operating system.

Yet turning up unbidden in productivity apps smacks of a 21st-century Clippy.
Particularly when a hunt is required to find the setting that switches the damn
thing off.

So much money is being poured in, and the AI bubble appears close to bursting.
Perhaps the pinprick of reality which arises from actually asking what customers
want before giving it to them is unthinkable.

After all, the benevolence of the tech industry has always looked after
customers. Nobody asked for never-ending updates, and yet here we are. Constant
redesigns and refinements of user interfaces rarely hit the top ten lists of
feature requests, yet customers get them anyway.

Without a choice to opt in, the beatings will continue until AI adoption
improves or users find that pesky opt-out option. ®
